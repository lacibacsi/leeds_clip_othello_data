# Othello game logic

Code taken from https://github.com/kevannguyen/Othello and adjusted where needed
(noted where changes are done)

Not using any of the UI / GUI functions, only board representation and game moves, legality checks

While othello is not a complex game to code, the goal of this project was not this and the referenced code was found to be easy to read and well built up in python
