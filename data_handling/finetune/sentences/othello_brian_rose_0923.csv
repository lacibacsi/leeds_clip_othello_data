Corners and Stable Discs

Chapter 2
Corners and stable discs
Perhaps the most basic strategy in Othello is to take the corners.

Q: What is the most basic strategy in Othello?

Referring to the passage above, the correct answer to the given question is",to take the corners
"You are given a new situation: Two teams, team A and team B, are playing a game of disc flipping. Team A has been doing very well and is currently winning the game. However, team B has just made an amazing flip and has taken one of team A's discs.

and a hint : By the rules of
play, it is impossible to flip a disc in a corner, so that if you are able to take a corner,
that disc will be yours for the rest of the game.

Please answer this question : Which team has a better chance of winning the game?",team A
"In Diagram 2-1, the disc on h8 must be
white at the end of the game: even if Black later moves to both g8 and h7, he can not
capture the disc on h8.

Q: What must be white at the end of the game?

A:",disc on h8
"You are given a new situation: David and John were playing disc games. David had a corner and was able to protect his discs from being flipped, but John didn't have a corner.

and a hint : Moreover, once you have a corner, it is often possible to build
a large number of discs that are protected by the corner and can never be flipped.

Please answer this question : Who would have a smaller chance of winning the game, David or John?",John
"Such discs are called stable discs.

With reference to the above context, What are discs that are stable called?",stable discs

In Diagram 2-2, the discs on the bottom row are stable discs, and in Diagram 2-
3, all 21 white discs are stable discs.

and the situation: John is trying to solve a Rubik's cube. He solves the first layer of the cube. He calls it as diagram 2-2. Then he solves the second layer of the cube. He calls it as diagram 2-3.

Answer the following question: Which layer has less stable discs, diagram 2-2 or diagram 2-3?",diagram 2-2
"If this is not obvious to you, then take some time
now to convince yourself.

Q: What is the narrator telling someone to do?

Referring to the passage above, the correct answer to the given question is",take some time
"I have a new situation: Two teams of two people each are playing a game of disc flipping. Team A has white discs, and team B has black discs. Each team has to flip the stable discs by placing their color discs wherever they like.

But I can use this background: Set up the positions on a board, then try to flip the stable
discs by placing black discs wherever you like.

What is an answer for this question: Which team has more stable discs?",Team B
"There is simply no way for Black to
get “behind” these discs to surround and flip them.

With reference to the above context, What is the only way Black can get behind these discs?",no way
"You are given a new situation: Two players are competing in a game of backgammon. The game is going well for Lloyd, as he has built up several stable discs. Lloyd's friend Tim is not having such good luck, as he has not been able to build any stable discs.

and a hint : The possibility of building up
stable discs usually makes corners very valuable, especially early in the game.

Please answer this question : Who has a less valuable position on the board?",Tim
"I read this background article the other day: If taking corners is that good, then it should be obvious that you usually do not
want to give any to your opponent!

I am facing a new situation today: Two teams of 11 players each are playing a game of soccer. The Red team is winning 4-1 over the Blue team. Late in the game, a player on the Blue team takes a corner kick and scores a goal for the Blue team.

Using the knowledge I have from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which team is less likely to take a corner kick?",Red
"Given the rules of the game, the only way for your
opponent to take a corner is if you play in one of the squares next to a corner, i.e., the
C-squares or X-squares.

Q: What is the only way for your opponent to take a corner?

A:",if you play in one of the squares next to a corner
"Given the following context:

The X-squares are particularly dangerous, and a move to an
X-square early in the game is almost certain to give up the adjacent corner.

answer the following question:

What is the name of the thing that is dangerous?",The X-squares
"For ex-
ample, in Diagram 2-4, White has just moved to the X-square at g7.

Q: What is the name of the diagram that shows White's move to the X-square?

A:",Diagram 2-4
"Although Black
can not take the h8 corner immediately, if he can establish even one disc on the c3-f6
diagonal, then Black will be able take the corner.

Q: What does Black need to do to take the corner?

A:",establish even one disc on the c3-f6

"Given the following context:

A Lifetime to Master
One possibility is for Black to play b5, capturing the disc on e5, as shown in
Diagram 2-5.

answer the following question:

What is the name of the person who could capture the disc on e5?",Black
"Given the following context:

No matter where White plays, he will not be able to recapture the e5
disc, and Black will be able to take the h8 corner on his next turn.

answer the following question:

Who will be able to take the h8 corner on his next turn?",Black
"I know that the answer to the question ""What is the first stable discs created?"" is in ""Once black has the
corner, all of his discs on row 8 become stable discs, and later in the game he is likely
to be able to create stable discs on the right edge as well."". Can you tell me what it is?",row 8
"In general, the earlier in the
game a corner is taken the more valuable it is, as the potential for building up stable
discs around the corner is greater.

Two teams were playing a game of corner. The red team took an early corner, but they didn't manage to score. The other team, the yellow team, took a late corner and they scored two goals from it.

Which team took a more valuable corner?",red
"In most cases, moving to an X-square early in the
game will prove to be a fatal error, although later in the book we will examine some
exceptional circumstances under which early X-square moves are useful.

Q: What is an X-square move?

Referring to the passage above, the correct answer to the given question is",moving to an X-square
"I know that the answer to the question ""What are the X-square moves?"" is in ""While moves to the X-square will usually allow the opponent to take the adja-
cent corner, for C-squares  the degree of danger depends largely on the rest of the
squares on the same edge."". Can you tell me what it is?",moves to the X-square
"Question: What is the pattern in Diagrams 2-6, 2-7, and 2-8?

Context: For example, in Diagrams 2-6, 2-7, and 2-8, Black will
quickly lose the h1 corner.

Answer:",Black will quickly lose the h1 corner

are quite often perfectly good moves, and frequently they involve no danger of giving
up a corner despite being adjacent to it.

the game do not allow you to pass your turn whenever you want, and there are some
circumstances under which you certainly would not want to pass, such as near the end
of the game when you are trying to build as many stable discs as possible.

The game is almost over, only a few pieces are left on the board. The pieces are all lined up in rows. Black just made his move and white is now thinking about his next move.

But I can use this background: If Black tries a6 or
g6 in Diagram 3-23, the black disc on d6 means that Black would have to flip some of
White’s frontier discs on row 6.

Diagonal control
The preceding examples were relatively easy, since one side had already run out
of moves.

Now, I have a new situation: David is a master at the game of Reversi. One day he was playing with his student, John. David taught John a very important lesson that day, a lesson that would take John a lifetime to master.

Answer this question please: Who had run out of moves?",John
"One common way to create this sort of situation is to use diagonal control,
i.e., to capture all of the discs on one of the diagonal lines on the board.

John and Keith are playing a game of Reversi. After a while, John realizes that he is in a losing position, so he decides to use diagonal control to increase his chances of winning.

Given the context: What is the concept of the twins?",a pair
"A swindle occurs when one player
gets both moves in a pair because, following the first move into the pair, the opponent
does not have a legal move to the other square in the pair.

Bob and Andy are playing a game of backgammon. Bob makes his move, and Andy makes his move. Bob then makes another move that Andy cannot counter. This is called a swindle.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: 

Who did not have a legal move?",Andy

In Diagram 6-34, it might
seem obvious that Black should play to h8, grabbing the entire right edge.

answer the following question:

What is the name of the person who should play to h8?",Black
"White will
end the game with g8 (Diagram 6-35), with White winning 33-31.

With reference to the above context, Who wins the game?",White

what happens if Black plays to g8 instead (Diagram 6-36).",Diagram 6-35
"In this case, White gets
swindled; he does not have access to h8, and must pass!

With reference to the above context, What does White not have access to?",h8
"Given the following context:

Black ends the game with h8,
winning 36-28 (Diagram 6-37).

What is the name of the person who ends the game with h8?",Black
"Diagram 6-38 shows another example of a swindle.

With reference to the above context, What kind of diagram is shown?",swindle
"Suppose that Black plays
a1, as in Diagram 6-39.

Q: What is the name of the diagram?

Referring to the passage above, the correct answer to the given question is",Diagram 6-39
"I have a game board like this:

White would like to wedge at b1, gaining access to h1.

And I am trying to answer this question: What will White want to do next?",wedge at b1
"How-
ever, in this case White can not play to b1 because he does not have a piece on the b
column.

White moves his pawn from b2 to b3. Black captures the pawn. White captures the pawn on b3 with his bishop. Black captures the bishop with his knight.

Who captured the bishop?",Black
"Given the following context:

Black will later move to b1 himself, creating many stable discs.

Answer the following question:

What will Black want to do next?",move to b1
"Also note
how this swindle gains valuable tempos for Black.

Q: What does the swindle gain for Black?

ever, there is another, equally important part of the game— preventing your opponent
from making the same sort of good moves that you are aiming for yourself.""

Answer:",preventing your opponent from making the same sort of good moves that you are aiming for yourself
"In this
chapter we discuss defensive plays which attempt to take away good moves from the
opponent.

Q: What are defensive plays designed to do?

A:",take away good moves from the opponent
"If you play through the transcript of any game between experts, you are
likely to find at least a few defensive moves.

A:",defensive moves
"There are essentially three types of defensive moves.

With reference to the above context, How many types of defensive moves are there?",three

which is clearly a good move.

Q: What is the move that White is threatening to take?

A:",a8 corner
"I can use this background: However, if Black makes a defensive play at g8, flip-
ping the white disc on f8, he can deny White access to the corner.

Now, I have a new situation: Two friends played backgammon. Tom was better at it. He won 3 games in a row.

Answer this question please: Which player made a defensive play at g8?",Tom
"Question: How does the second type of defensive move work?

Context: ""The second type of defensive move is to play where your opponent wants to

Suddenly, Tom made a loud move and took the corner. It was an attractive move for Tom. But David was not upset about it. He just smiled and said, ""Good move, Tom. Good move.""

But I can use this background: In this case, taking the
corner is attractive for Black as well, but in other circumstances it pays to play in your
opponent’s spot, even if it is a relatively loud move.

What is an answer for this question: Who would make a relatively loud move?",Tom

Mike is playing a game of pool with his friend John. John hits the cue ball and the balls start to spread all over the table. After they settle, a black ball is right next to a yellow ball and a blue ball. Mike has to hit the black ball, but he isn't sure which ball to hit after that.

Which ball should Mike hit after the black ball?",either the yellow ball or the blue ball

What is the name of the person who has two possible corner attacks?",Black
"I can use this background: In
either case, if White takes the a8 corner on his next turn, then Black will wedge,
winning a corner.

Now, I have a new situation: David and John are playing a game of checkers. David has just taken a piece and it is now John's turn. John moves his piece and David moves his piece. David then takes the a8 corner on his next turn. John then takes the c8 corner.

Stoner trap varieties
So far, we have looked only at the basic Stoner trap.

I am facing a new situation today: Mike and Chris are two friends that enjoy smoking marijuana in their free time. One day, Mike came across a new strain of marijuana that had been imported from Afghanistan. This new strain was a Stoner trap variety and it made Mike feel amazing. Chris has yet to try it, but he is planning on picking some up at the store later.

Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Who will feel better after smoking marijuana?",Mike

"Given the following context:

As discussed in
Chapter 5, there are many situations where two squares form a pair: two squares such
that if a player moves to one the squares, the opponent’s best move is normally to
move to the other.

answer the following question:

In which chapter is it discussed that two squares form a pair?",Chapter 5
"A swindle occurs when a player moves into the pair, but the oppo-
nent does not have a legal move to the other square of the pair, allowing the first
player to get both moves in the pair.

With reference to the above context, What happens when a player moves into the pair?",A swindle
"Given the following context:

There are situations where a player can get both
moves in a pair because the opponent does not want to move into the other half of the
pair; a swindle occurs only when the opponent can not move into the other half.

Answer the following question:

If a player gets both moves in a pair, what has happened?",a swindle

"If Black plays
a1, White will want to wedge at b1, winning the h1 corner-- presumably that is why
White played to b2 in the first place.

Q: What would black want to play?

A:",a1
"Question: What is the result of Black moving to a1?

Context: However, in this case, Black can “swindle”
White, moving to a1 without giving White access to b1.

Answer:",without giving White access to b1
"Black can later move to b1
and wins easily.

Q: What does Black do?

A:",wins easily

Edges as shapes
Among Othello experts, there has been a lot of debate over whether taking edges
is good or bad.

Now, I have a new situation: Dan and Bob are two friends that play Othello a lot. They are both very good at the game. They are having a rematch tonight, and the winner gets to keep Dan's prized first edition hardcover copy of Pride and Prejudice.

Answer this question please: Who should take edges?",Dan
"Looking at a position like Diagram 5-11, it is easy to understand why
most novices are warned against taking too many edges.

Q: What position is being looked at?

Referring to the passage above, the correct answer to the given question is",Diagram 5-11
"Edges may be subject to
various attacks, and can also make it difficult to find quiet moves when the edges act
as poison discs.

Q: What may be subject to various attacks?

A:",Edges
"Certainly, simply taking an edge any time one is available is not
going to be a work against someone who has a reasonable idea of proper strategy.

Q: What does not work against someone who has a reasonable idea of proper strategy?

A:",taking an edge
"While there is no true consensus, most experts would probably agree with the
idea that taking edges is good for gaining tempos in the midgame, but often leads to
problems later in the game.

With reference to the above context, What is the consensus on taking edges?",no true consensus
"I know that the answer to the question ""What might be considered bad shape?"" is in ""In terms of the current discussion, we might think of
most edge positions as bad shape, even if they are not immediately subject to attack."". Can you tell me what it is?",most edge positions
"Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. 

Which player will take more edges?

Two players are taking turns placing tiles on a board. The first player, Tom, takes the edges and places them first, but the second player, Bill, does not take the edges and waits until he has all his tiles to place them all at once.

Hint: If taking edges makes bad shapes, then you have to read ahead to decide whether an
edge is worth taking.",Tom
"I have a new situation: David and John are playing a game of rubik's cube. David solves the cube and wins a prize. John is upset he didn't win and vows to learn how to solve the rubik's cube.

But I can use this background: In Diagram 12-15, Black holds two edges which are adjacent in the sense that
they are both connected to the h8 corner.

What is an answer for this question: Who is more likely to solve the rubik's cube, David or John?",David
"Given the following context:

Holding adjacent edges can be a powerful
strategy, and experience shows that it is usually better to occupy adjacent edges rather
than opposing edges.

answer the following question:

What is usually better to occupy?",adjacent edges

Passage: While the bottom and right edges in Diagram 12-15 are both
bad shape, White has no way to attack them.

Question: What is White's problem?",has no way to attack them
"In the process of taking adjacent edges,
it is often possible to gain tempos, forcing your opponent to build walls.

Q: What can be gained in the process of taking adjacent edges?

A:",tempos
"In some cases, it is possible to completely run your opponent out of moves in the
midgame by grabbing the long diagonal connecting adjacent edges.

Q: What is the name of the diagonal connecting adjacent edges?

Referring to the passage above, the correct answer to the given question is",long diagonal

Context: ""(Diagram 12-21).""

Answer:",(Diagram 12-21)
"I can use this background: Black can (and did) break the diagonal by playing a6, but White can again control the
diagonal with b7 (Diagram 12-22), winning easily.

Now, I have a new situation: John and Keith are playing a round of checkers. After Keith makes his move, John checks him and says ""keith you just lost the game"" confused Keith asks how. John simply replies ""you just lost the diagonal"".

Answer this question please: Who is more likely to win the game?",John
"Note, however, that if the diago-
nal grab was not available in Diagram 12-20 (for example if the disc on e4 were white
rather than black), then White’s bad edges would give Black the advantage.

Othello: A Minute to Learn...A Lifetime to Master
The main advantage of using the plus/minus method is that there is no need to
count the number of Black discs in Diagram 13-1.

I am facing a new situation today: Bill is teaching his son how to play the plus/minus method in the Othello game. His son is currently on Diagram 13-1.

Using the knowledge I have from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Is Bill's son a beginner or expert?",beginner
"If a8 is +6 and b8 is +7, then b8 is
better, end of story.

Mike is a chess player and plays in tournaments all over the world. Yesterday, he played two different opponents, opponent A and opponent B. In his first game his b8 was +6 but in the second game his b8 was +7. In the first game his opponent's b8 was +5 but in the second game his opponent's b8 was +4. Obviously, Mike would enjoy second game more than the first game.

Would Mike's b8 be better or worse in the second game than in the first game?",better

Q: What is the name of the method that the writer uses to figure out the right move?

A:",plus/minus method
"Moreover, if you do bother to count the number
of discs in the initial position, then the plus/minus method will still let you determine
the final score.

Ash and Mike are playing a game of pool. They both agree that the winner is the first person to sink the eight ball. Mike sinks the first ball, and Ash sinks the second. Ash sinks the third ball, but Mike sinks the fourth ball. Mike sinks the fifth ball, but Ash sinks the sixth ball. Mike sinks the seventh ball, but Ash sinks the eighth ball and wins the game.

Who won the game of pool?",Ash
"I have a new situation: David is trying to figure out how many discs he needs to order for a new project. He has narrowed it down to two options, option A and option B. Option A requires 26 discs, and option B requires 33 discs. He is trying to decide which option to go with.

But I can use this background: In our example, if we calculate that b8 is +7, then the final disc count
must be the initial count, 26, plus 7, or 33.

What is an answer for this question: Which option has a lower final disc count?",option A
"I can use this background: If you never plan on counting positions with more than 2 empty squares, then
plus/minus is probably better than counting discs.
