Othello: From Beginner to Master ‚Äì A Few Words 
Copyright ¬© 2003, Randy Fang 
 
A FEW WORDS 
After the 2003 US National Championships, I set out on a mission to do what few others have even 
attempted ‚Äì to write a book about Othello.  Former World Champion Brian Rose has been writing his 
book for over 3 years and every time I asked the other tournament regulars about it, there was no new 
news on it.  I finally decided that I was tired of waiting and started to work on my own book. 
 
While most of my counterparts are usually only playing against other top players, I play many games 
against people who are still learning, and I think I have special insight into the kinds of questions that 
they might have.  I‚Äôve put a lot of effort into the diagrams and exercises, in fact, many of the exercises 
in this book are based on positions that I consistently see beginning level players misplay. 
 
I‚Äôm sure that there are mistakes in this version.  In fact, every time I go through it I find one more thing 
I need to fix, however, I think that the form that it is in now is suitable for general consumption.  I‚Äôm still 
working on the rest of the book.  It‚Äôs taken me three full months to get through the beginner material.  I
According to the above context, answer the following question.
What does the author do for a living?",He is a professional Othello player.
"Read the following article and answer the question.
Article: imagine it will take me three months to four months get through the intermediate section, and another 
three months to four months get through the advanced section.   
 
Once I finish all of this and re-edit it (add a table of contents, for instance), I intend to look for a 
publisher.  If there is no interest in it from the established publishing community, I will be looking into 
selling it (the thought of printing out copies at Kinko‚Äôs and shipping them myself has crossed my 
mind).  Part of the reason I‚Äôm giving this away is that it‚Äôs good for the Othello community.  I‚Äôm also 
hoping that people will like it and it will generate interest in my book.  If you have any comments, or 
you would like to point out any serious errors, please feel free to do so.  I‚Äôve set up a Yahoo group 
specifically for discussion about the book at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/randysothellobook.

INTRODUCTION

You‚Äôre probably reading this book because you want to learn how to play Othello‚Ñ¢* well.  Maybe 
you‚Äôve just learned the game or maybe you don‚Äôt know it at all.  My goal is to speed up the process to 
mastery by stepping you through many of the lessons that every master level player has learned 
through hard work and a lot of practice. I‚Äôll start off at the most basic level and progress from basic
Question: What is the author‚Äôs purpose in writing the book?
Answer:",To teach readers how to play Othello.
"principles to some of the more flexible principles and exceptions that Master level players apply in 
championship level play. 
 
In essence, what I‚Äôm trying to do is write the Othello equivalent of Nimzovich‚Äôs My System (a chess 
book).  At the current time, there is no book in the Othello world to form the basis for discussion and 
analysis of games.  Most master level discussions in the US occur over a real board at infrequent 
tournaments and I‚Äôve tried to present as much of the terminology as possible.  By no means is all the 
information complete and it‚Äôs only as accurate as myself and the people I‚Äôve consulted while writing 
the material.  Just like My System has done in chess ‚Äì this book is meant to provide a basis for 
analytical discussion as well as revisions and exceptions to the theories presented. 
 
I‚Äôd also like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who is involved in the Othello community for 
their support.  I‚Äôd particularly like to thank Gunnar Anderson for making WZebra and its toolset for 
making the images in this document freely available. 
 
Finally, many deserved thanks go out to my two editors and good friends: Amanda Jones (writing 
style and beginner level feedback) and Edmund Yiu (technical and master level feedback).

Before we start, I‚Äôd like to take a moment to talk about what equipment you might want to get your 
hands on before reading this book.  As a minimum requirement, you‚Äôll need to have an Othello board 
of some kind on hand to play a few sample games with yourself or preferably with an opponent to get 
a feel for the rules and principles that I will introduce. 
 
If you‚Äôre more technologically inclined , I recommend you download WZebra from the Internet 
(http://www.nada.kth.se/~gunnar/othello.html). You can use it to set up the positions presented in the 
book or to play a few quick games to get acquainted with how to play.  For beginning through 
advanced players, the lowest skill setting on WZebra will provide a HIGHLY challenging opponent , 
don‚Äôt be discouraged, WZebra is a very strong player.  You might consider downloading one of the 
‚Äúweaker‚Äù Othello playing programs to play with so you don‚Äôt get discouraged.  A much better idea is to 
seek out competition on the Internet.  There are several places that you can play online, here‚Äôs a short

Othello Notation 
 
 
 
Standard Starting Position 
 
On the left you‚Äôll find the standard Othello starting 
position.  Each side starts with two disks in the 
center of the board. 
 
Standard Othello notation is based on a grid.  The 
letters run from left to right and represent the 
columns.  The numbers run from top to bottom 
and represent the rows.  This means that the top-
left corner is A1, the bottom-left corner is A8, the 
top-right corner is H1, and the bottom-right corner 
is H8.   In the standard starting position, black 
has disks at E4 and D5.  White has disks at D4 
and E5.

All the diagrams in this book will have the 
columns and rows labeled appropriately on the 
top and left edges so, while memorization of this 
grid will be helpful, it should not be necessary.

Rules of Othello 
 
Objective 
To have the most discs at the end of the game. 
General Rules 
 
Each player starts with 32 disks at hand.  One side of each disk is black, the other side is 
white. 
 
One player plays their disks white side up and the other player plays their  disks black side up.  
The player playing their disks white side up is called white, the player playing their disks black 
side up is called black 
 
Black always plays first.  
 
Both players take turns playing valid moves into empty squares.  (Black plays, then White 
plays, then Black plays, then White plays, etc).  After playing a valid move, the appropriate 
disks are ‚Äúflipped‚Äù to the current player‚Äôs color.  (See the following example for more details on 
valid moves and flipping disks). 
 
If a player has no valid moves‚Äì they must pass their turn.  The other player then plays a 
second turn in a row.  If the second player still has no legal moves, they must pass again.  
This means that a player can potentially move 2, 3, or even 15 times in a row.  When a player 
passes, they give one of their disks to their opponent. 

Question: What does the author think about the game?
Answer:",It's fun.
"passes, they give one of their disks to their opponent. 
 
The game ends when both players have no legal moves ‚Äì in most cases this is when the 
board has no empty squares left.  In rare cases ‚Äì the game will end because neither player 
has a legal move in the position. 
 
Valid Moves: 
 
Moves must be played to an empty square adjacent to a disk of the opposing color 
 
You must play a move that ‚Äúoutflanks‚Äù disks of the opposing color. Disks that are 
‚Äúoutflanked‚Äù are flipped to the color of the disk that was played.

A Simple Example: 
 
 
STANDARD START POSITION 
AFTER BLACK PLAYS E6 
 
From the standard starting position, black plays a move to the E6 square.  The E4 and E6 disks now 
outflank the disk on the E5 square and the white E5 disk is flipped to black. 
 
 
 
BEFORE WHITE PLAYS F4 
AFTER WHITE PLAYS F4 
 
As the second move of the game, the white player plays to the F4 square.  The disk on E4 is 
outflanked by the D4 and F4 disks and it is flipped to white.

In this position, white plays to C5 outflanking the disks on C3 and C4 and they are flipped.  Note that 
there aren‚Äôt any ‚Äúchain reactions‚Äù , for instance, even though the disks on D4 and E4 are now 
‚Äúoutflanked‚Äù by the disks on C4 (which just flipped) and F4 ‚Äì they are NOT flipped.

FOR BEGINNERS 
 
Othello 101 
 
I‚Äôd like to start with a metaphor.  In chess, the first step that a beginner would take is to understand 
the relative value of the different chess pieces.  A beginner‚Äôs book on chess might start by showing 
the readers a short table like the following.  If the total value of your pieces is more than the value of 
your opponents pieces then you‚Äôre probably winning. 
 
Queen 
9 pts 
Rook 
5 pts 
Bishop 
3 pts 
Knight 
3 pts 
Pawn 
1 pts

"Using this simple rule, a complete beginner at chess would expect to win more than half of their 
games against another complete beginner who doesn‚Äôt know it.  Obviously, in any undertaking as 
complex as chess, one simple rule falls far short of complete understanding.  As a beginner becomes 
more advanced and progresses, they will learn new rules ‚Äì as well as some exceptions to them.  In 
much the same way, we will begin with a few basic rules of winning Othello and then build on them.

Corners Are Good 
For beginning and intermediate players, games often revolve around battles for corners.  As a first 
step, let‚Äôs take a look at a classic example of how important corners are. 
 
 
White To Play 
 
Looking at the above position, a complete beginner might assume that black is winning by a large 
margin.  After all, black has 59 disks while white only has 1.  Unfortunately, not very many of black‚Äôs 
disks will remain black at the end of the game, in fact, in this position, white will get to play to all four 
corners (because black will have no legal moves) and will win the game.  It doesn‚Äôt matter what order 
the moves are played in as they all result in the same finishing position.  Let‚Äôs look at the moves as 
they‚Äôre played.

WHITE PLAYS H8 
WHITE PLAYS H1 
White wins 40-24! 
A reasonable question at this point might be - Why are corners important?  The simple answer is that 
a corner is a guaranteed stable disk because there are no moves that outflank a corner.  A stable 
disk is a disk that your opponent can never flip back to his or her color.  Obviously, the more disks 
you have that are guaranteed to be your color at the end of the game, the more likely you are to win 
the game. Another great thing about corners is that you can use them to build more stable disks.  
Let‚Äôs take a look at another fantasy board to demonstrate how stable disks can be built from corners. 
 
 
WHITE TO PLAY 
 
Here, white can create stable disks along either the A column or the 1 row by building off of the A1 
corner.  An example of this is on the next page.

Note that the 9 white disks on the edge from A1-A5 and from A1-E1 are all stable ‚Äì however, the 
white disks on B4, C3, and D2, while they can‚Äôt be flipped in the current position, are not yet stable.  
For instance, if white were to play F2 then black could play G2 which would flip the D2 disk. While 
white is guaranteed a score of at least 9 at the end of the game, black has no stable disks at all.  Let‚Äôs

"take a look at an example illustrating how building off of corners will result in accumulating stable 
disks. 
 
 
BLACK TO PLAY 
 
Black can play either A7 or H1 and get more stable disks.  Following the rule that corners are very 
valuable, we will build towards the corner at H1.  White will then have to pass because white will have 
no legal moves.

Copyright ¬© 2003, Randy Fang

BLACK PLAYS H1 ‚Äì WHITE PASSES 
BLACK PLAYS G2 
 
Since we are building towards the H1 corner, we should try to consolidate the northeast region of the 
board and fill it in with black disks, in the meantime, we are going to save the move to A7 (because it 
won‚Äôt go away) until later.  We‚Äôll play G2 which forces white to play G3 because white has no other 
valid moves. 
 
 
 
WHITE PLAYS G3 
BLACK PLAYS H3 
 
Othello: From Beginner to Master ‚Äì Othello 101 
Copyright ¬© 2003, Randy Fang 
 
18 
 
After white plays G3, we‚Äôll play H3 because this gives us 3 more stable disks and helps consolidate 
even more of the northeast region to black.  Again, we‚Äôll leave white a move here.  Often, when you‚Äôre 
building you‚Äôll need to leave moves for your opponent.  Yes, white gets a disk at G3 and at H2 for the 
moment, however, look how quickly, those disks both turn into stable disks for black in that region.  By 
forcing white to play there after black already has the corner to build off of, black can turn those disks 
into stable black disks.

Let‚Äôs stop here and assess the situation.  Black already has 31 stable disks and has guaranteed that 
even if the 2 unstable black disks (D5 and E5) get flipped to white and white gets stable disks on the 
rest of the squares (very unlikely), black will still only lose the game 33-31.  If black were a 
conservative player, black could play A7 next, which would give black 7 more stable disks and 
guarantee at least a 38-26 win.  Unfortunately for white, black doesn‚Äôt have to play A7 which ‚Äúonly‚Äù 
wins 58-6 with perfect endgame play.  Instead, black can play F7 which leads to a perfect play win by 
wipeout for black.  A wipeout is the term for when one player ends the game with zero disks left on 
the board.  In this game the final score after perfect play is 62-0 for black.  Here‚Äôs a transcript that 
shows the perfect endgame from the original starting position:

In either case, black can now take the A1 corner!  None of the other valid moves for white from the 
starting position give black a corner on the very next turn.  The thing we can learn from this is that the
According to the above context, answer the following question.
What is the most likely reason that the author wrote this book?",to teach people how to play othello
"squares adjacent to the corner are dangerous to play into.  Othello terminology has special names for 
these squares: C-squares and X-squares. 
 
 
C-squares are adjacent to the corner on the 
edge.   
 
In the diagram to the left, the white disks are the 
C-squares on the board. 
 
 
 
 
X-squares are the squares that are adjacent to 
the corner diagonally.   
 
In the diagram to the left, the white squares are 
the X-squares. 
 
 
 
Now that we have the correct vocabulary, we can summarize what we‚Äôve learned so far: corners are 
good, while C-squares and X-squares are dangerous for us to play into because if we‚Äôre not careful, 
our opponent will take a corner when we play into them.  Even when there is no immediate threat of 
your opponent taking the corner, it‚Äôs usually best to stay away from C-squares and X-squares.  Let‚Äôs 
take a look at a couple of examples:

In the above diagram, white has just played H7.  After black plays H6, black is guaranteed to win the 
H8 corner.  If white doesn‚Äôt take the disk at H6 by playing H5, black takes the corner.  If white does 
take the disk at H6 by playing H5, black will still have a disk at H4 and black can take the H8 corner 
on the next turn.

This is not to say that all C-squares are bad.  In both the above examples, notice how the C-squares 
that were played aren‚Äôt adjacent to any other white edge disks.  C-squares tend to be bad when they 
are isolated.  They aren‚Äôt as bad when you have disks adjacent to them on the edge.

For example: In the following diagram, the C-squares at B1 and G1 aren‚Äôt a liability for black because 
there isn‚Äôt a way for white to attack them.  In fact, as we‚Äôll discuss later on, edges where you have 6 
disks (B1 through G1 in this case) are one of the best edge formations you can have.

Greed is One of the Seven Deadly Sins 
 
In the last section, I talked about the importance of corners.  Obviously, corners aren‚Äôt available at the 
beginning of the game.  What you really want to know next is: what other rules can I follow during the 
rest of the game so that I have a chance at beating more than just beginners?  If you followed my 
advice and played a few games with some beginning and intermediate players, you may have started 
to notice a pattern.   
 
Let‚Äôs take a look at a sample position: 
 
 
 
BLACK TO PLAY 
 
 
What assets does white have in the above position?  He‚Äôs got a lot of pieces, certainly.  To the 
untrained eye, it might even look like white is way ahead (after all, white has more pieces!).  But if you 
look more closely, while it‚Äôs black‚Äôs turn to move, white only has 2 legal moves in the above position.
According to the above context, answer the following question.
How long has Randy Fang probably played Othello?",For many years
"And what‚Äôs worse BOTH of those moves will let black have the corner shortly afterwards.  From the 
last section, we know that that has to be bad news for white.  Luckily for white ‚Äì black has to play a 
move here.  Black has lots of choices, from the absolutely horrendous G2 (giving up a corner) to B5 to 
E1.  If black were to play B5 here, white would then play A5 or B6 (as the other 3 legal moves in the 
position would  give away a corner).

BLACK PLAYS B5 
WHITE PLAYS A5 
 
That hasn‚Äôt made any progress for black and it is black‚Äôs turn to move again.  What if black played A5 
here instead?  White would respond A6 (because black would then be threatening to take the corner 
by playing along the A edge if white were to play B5). 
 
 
 
BLACK PLAYS A5 
WHITE PLAYS A6 
 
This also doesn‚Äôt accomplish much.  Unfortunately for white, black has a much better move here,E1.  
After E1, white STILL has the same 2 moves that lose the corner.

BLACK PLAYS E1 
 
I like to call moves like E1 the killer move because after this the game is effectively over and it turns 
into a process of getting the corner in the best way and building from there.  Similarly, there are often 
sequences of 2 or more moves that win immediately and I call those killer sequences.
According to the above context, answer the following question.
What is the name of the book that the author wrote?",Othello: From Beginner to Master
"sequences of 2 or more moves that win immediately and I call those killer sequences. 
 
In Othello terminology, a quiet move is a move that doesn‚Äôt disturb the position very much.  On the 
other hand, a loud move is a move that changes the position significantly.  In fact, in the above 
example E1 is a Perfectly Quiet Move because it flips exactly 1 disk and it provides no new moves to 
the opponent (therefore it‚Äôs as quiet as any legal move in Othello can be ‚Äì it doesn‚Äôt change the board 
very much at all).  To clarify a bit more, your opponent will have the same (or fewer) moves both 
before and after you play a Perfectly Quiet Move.  In the above example, before black plays E1, 
white can play to B1 and B2.  After black plays to E1, white STILL can only play to B1 and B2.  As a 
general rule, if there is a perfectly quiet move on the board it is almost always the right move to play. 
 
What can we learn from the above position?  With good play, you can force your opponent to give you 
corners ‚Äì even if they‚Äôve discovered how valuable corners are and they are also avoiding playing into 
X-squares and C-squares.  The real question is: how do you get into positions where your opponent 
will have to give you a corner?

G2 isn‚Äôt much better than H3.  In fact the only way that white can try to hold on is to play H2, a

D1.

So if it‚Äôs black‚Äôs turn, white will lose.  What about if it‚Äôs white‚Äôs turn?  White could play H3 ,making a 
black move to H6 pointless (White just plays H7 after H6), however then black will just play E1 
instead, forcing white to play D1 and then black will play C1 forcing white to lose a corner.   
 
Obviously, whatever it is about the previous starting positions that is bad, it carries over no matter 
whose turn it is.  In order to figure out how to force our opponents to give us corners, we need to 
figure out what features the two diagrammed positions have in common.  White‚Äôs real problem in both 
positions is that he doesn‚Äôt really have a lot of options to begin with and the options that he has aren‚Äôt 
very good.  When you have lots of moves to choose from you are said to ‚Äúhave lots of mobility‚Äù.  
When you don‚Äôt have many moves to choose from you are ‚Äúlow on mobility‚Äù.  Having good mobility  
(having good moves) is a very important part of the game.  If you have a lot of mobility ‚Äì at least a few 
of those moves are bound to be good.  And the opposite is true, if you don‚Äôt have very many moves ‚Äì 
you might not have any good moves at all.

Question: What is the purpose of the passage?
Answer:",To teach how to play Othello.
"Read the following context and answer the question.
Context: Many games between an expert and a beginner are decided in terms of mobility alone.  The expert 
quickly runs the beginner out of good moves, and then forces the beginner to give up a corner (by 
leaving the beginner one or two moves that both lose a corner) and from there it‚Äôs all a matter of 
technique. 
 
Why doesn‚Äôt white have much mobility in the above diagrams?  Because black doesn‚Äôt have a lot of 
disks., Obviously if black only has 3 or 4 disks, white will probably have only 2 or 3 moves.  If those 2 
or 3 moves are all moves that give away a corner, then black is probably going to win.  The point I‚Äôm 
trying to make here is that by having fewer disks, you can get into positions where your opponent is 
forced to give you a corner.  Having fewer disks is actually better most of the time! 
 
Unfortunately, this can be a very difficult lesson to learn.  The ‚Äúgoal‚Äù of the game is to get the most 
disks, right?  Wrong.  The goal of the game is to have the most disks at the end of the game.  We‚Äôve 
already seen how having corners leads to stable disks and we know that stable disks lead to more 
disks at the end of the game.  In between the start and the end of the game, our goal is to put 
ourselves into a position where we‚Äôre likely to have the most disks at the end of the game.  If this 
means having fewer disks in the opening and midgame, then so be it.

Question: What does Randy Fang probably think about Othello?
===
The answer to the above question is",He likes it.
"Read the following context and answer the question.
Context: to get wiped out if you completely commit yourself to minimizing your disks.  The term for this situation 
is overevaporation.  Unfortunately, you can‚Äôt always focus on just minimizing your disks,you 
sometimes have to pay attention to make sure that you‚Äôre not going to wipe out.  Remember having 
fewer disks is a means to forcing your opponent to give you corners, it is not an end in and of itself. 
 
In order to avoid being wiped out by someone who is playing greedily, you‚Äôll want to try to play moves 
that do 1 of 3 things (in this order of importance): 
 
 
Establish a stronghold on an edge that your opponent can‚Äôt flip 
 
Play a move that flips disks in more than one direction at once 
 
Play a move that makes a line that is not immediately reflippable. 
 
Let‚Äôs take a look at examples of each of these in turn. 
Establish a stronghold on an edge that your opponent can‚Äôt flip 
Edge disks are harder to flip than regular disks as they can only be flipped by other disks on the edge, 
instead of in 8 different ways like all the other disks.  By establishing a stronghold on the edge and not 
letting your opponent flip those disks, you guarantee yourself that you‚Äôll have some disks to play off of 
later in the game.

Question: What is probably true about Randy Fang?
Answer:",He is an expert in Othello
"In the above example, black could play moves like E7 or E2 that immediately get wiped out.  For 
instance, if black played E7 white would play E8.  In order to avoid being wiped out, black can try to 
establish a stronghold on an edge that White will never be able to flip.  For instance, if black were to 
play H5, then white can never take black off of the edge because no matter where white plays along 
the edge, black can just capture along the edge and protect his stronghold. 
 
 
 
WHITE PLAYS H4 
BLACK PLAYS H3 
 
For instance, if white tries to get on the edge with H4, black will just take the edge with H3.  As long as 
white can‚Äôt take black‚Äôs edge disks, black can‚Äôt be wiped out.  Notice that in the original diagram black 
had several other possible edge moves (A5, H4, H7), however, H5 is the quietest move and it leaves 
white with the fewest options (in fact , it‚Äôs an easy win for black), and that makes H5 the correct 
choice.

39 
Flip in more than one direction at once 
If you are dangerously low on disks, flipping more disks will help you avoid being wiped out.  That is 
one of the reasons that flipping in more than one direction at once is good.  You tend to flip more 
disks when you flip in more than one direction. Also, your opponent can never wipe you out on the 
move immediately following a move in which you‚Äôve flipped in more than one direction.

Article: Black To Move 
Black Plays B4 
 
In the above position, establishing a stronghold on the edge by playing C8 doesn‚Äôt work because then 
white plays E8 and neither player has any more legal moves (and thus white wins).  Obviously 
another idea is in order.  An example safe move is for black to play B4 which flips disks in 2 
directions.  After this move, white can‚Äôt wipe black out during his or her next move.  
 
Make a line that is not immediately reflippable 
Obviously if a line is not immediately reflippable then your opponent can‚Äôt wipe you out on the next 
move.  Making a non-reflippable line is usually a delaying tactic that you will use until you can play 
moves that meet one of the two above criteria.

So you‚Äôre looking at the position on the last page and you‚Äôre wondering ‚ÄúOK, black has a lot fewer 
disks and white has very poor mobility. How does black win a corner?‚Äù  The answer is: black can‚Äôt win 
a corner in this position (at least ‚Äì not in the next couple of moves).  What‚Äôs different about this 
position?  Because of black‚Äôs disk placement, white only has one ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù move that he could 
play if it were his turn, A2.  It is very easy for white to avoid playing to A2.  Let‚Äôs play fantasy Othello 
for a bit and move one disk on the board slightly: 
 
 
BLACK TO PLAY 
 
Now black does have a move that wins a corner (black plays B1 and white must play B2).  You should 
notice that in the second diagram, the disk that previously was in the middle of the board is now on 
the edge.  In fact, in all of the winning positions that were presented in the last chapter as examples 
(and in the current example as well), all of the correct moves for black to play (because they force 
white to lose a corner) were edge moves.  As mentioned in the last chapter, edge disks can only be
Question: Why did black win?
===
The answer to the above question is",because of black's disk placement
"white to lose a corner) were edge moves.  As mentioned in the last chapter, edge disks can only be 
flipped along the edge so this means that edge moves tend to be quieter than non-edge moves.  
Quieter moves give your opponent fewer options the next turn.  Eventually if you can play enough 
quiet edge moves, your opponent will run out of other moves and have to give you a corner.  This 
simple strategy is known as edge creeping because you are attempting to creep slowly along the 
edge until you win a corner. 
 
Another thing that you should notice is that in the original diagram, the black disk is on the outside of 
the mass of white disks where it could be flipped ‚Äì which means that white has a couple of possible 
moves to begin with.  Disks that are on the outside of a mass of opposite colored disks that can be 
flipped are called frontier disks.  The edge disk in the second example isn‚Äôt a frontier disk at the 
current time because it can‚Äôt be flipped.  In the future, white may get a disk at D1 or black could play 
to D1 in which case C1 would become a frontier disk.  Since every frontier disk provides your 
opponent with a potential move, having,fewer frontier disks mean that you have a better position.

Simple Opening Advice 
 Understanding is the key 
 More of the same 
 A few new ideas 
 Pay attention! 
 
In chess, one of the biggest mistakes that I feel that beginning players make is to assign too much 
importance to the openings.  They feel that better players are ‚Äútricking them‚Äù by being better prepared 
in the openings.  So, they rush out and buy a book of openings and start memorizing them.  While I 
feel that having an opening repertoire is useful for a more seasoned player, it is much more important 
for a beginner to understand the WHY of an opening.  When you memorize openings without 
understanding why you are making the moves, the instant you venture into unfamiliar territory, you are 
likely to blunder.  What I do recommend is to keep your eyes open and trying to learn from your 
mistakes. 
 
Do you keep making the same kinds of moves and keep getting into bad positions because of them?  
I know it sounds obvious, but figure out what it is that you‚Äôre doing wrong and try not to do it anymore.  
Thinking about what concepts and ideas do work and what ones don‚Äôt work will help you all the way 
from beginner through master.
According to the above context, answer the following question.
Why does the author recommend learning from mistakes?",because you will make mistakes
"Read the following article and answer the question.
Article: from beginner through master. 
 
Now that I‚Äôve encouraged you to experiment and discover openings on your own, I‚Äôll try to give some 
general advice about what you should be trying to accomplish during an opening.  Much of what I 
have to say is similar to the advice that I‚Äôve given in the previous sections but it doesn‚Äôt hurt to re-
iterate it here.   
 
 
Try not to take too many disks.   
 
Try to head for the edges.   
 
Try to limit your frontier.   
 
Don‚Äôt play into X-squares or C-squares where you‚Äôre putting yourself in a dangerous position.   
 
In addition to these basic concepts, there are a few new concepts I‚Äôd like to introduce here as well. 
 
The first concept I‚Äôd like to introduce is the Sweet 16 ‚Äì this term refer to the central 16 squares of the 
board: 
 
 
Othello: From Beginner to Master ‚Äì Simple Opening Advice

43 
 
THE SWEET SIXTEEN 
 
 
In the opening it‚Äôs generally better to play a move into the Sweet 16 than another move elsewhere on 
the board.  It also stands to reason that preventing your opponent from getting moves into the Sweet 
16 is also a good thing.  Disks played in the sweet 16 don‚Äôt let your opponent reach an edge (where 
they may try to edge creep).  Additionally, disks in the Sweet 16 are less likely to remain frontier disks 
during the course of a game. 
 
 
Another useful rule is that staying in the middle of 
your opponent‚Äôs disks is good.   
 
This is called staying central.
Question: What is the purpose of the passage?
Answer:",To give advice on how to play Othello.
"your opponent‚Äôs disks is good.   
 
This is called staying central. 
 
Notice that white only has two frontier disks (B4 
and B4) in this position because white‚Äôs disks are 
central to black‚Äôs disks.  As we discovered in the 
last section, having fewer frontier disks is usually 
a good thing. 
 
 
Another good idea is to stay compact.  Being compact means that you don‚Äôt want your disks spread 
out all over the place.  You definitely don‚Äôt want spaces in between your disks because those squares 
are very likely places for your opponent to play to stay central to your disks.  Notice how in the 
previous example all of white‚Äôs disks are in one big clump while black‚Äôs disks are almost cut in two by 
white‚Äôs disks.  In the example, white is compact and black isn‚Äôt.  Staying compact also tends to lead to 
fewer frontier disks.

BLACK TO PLAY 
BLACK PLAYS C4 
 
One good way to stay compact, central, and to avoid having a lot of frontier disks is to play a move 
that reflips one of the disks that your opponent just flipped.  For example, in the above diagram, white 
has just played to C3.  Black responds by reflipping the disk at D4 by playing to C4.  After this move, 
black is both central and compact. 
 
Before I close out this chapter let‚Äôs take a look at a common mistake that I see beginners make very 
often that emphasizes the necessity of staying central and compact.

AFTER D2 
AFTER F2 
 
D2 and F2 ‚Äì D2 and F2 only flip one disk but they have several other drawbacks.  They‚Äôre not in the 
Sweet 16 and they‚Äôre not central either, in fact, either D2 or F2 will become frontier disks in typical

Simple Midgame Advice 
 It‚Äôs all about mobility 
 Tempo 
 
As we‚Äôve noticed in the previous sections, having and keeping mobility is a very important thing.  
When you run out of mobility it‚Äôs very likely that your opponent is going to force you to give up a 
corner and they will win.  In the midgame, your job is usually to avoid running out of mobility while 
retaining a good position and trying to run your opponent out of mobility in return.  Often, you will find 
that there are moves that you are forced to play or your opponent will run you out of mobility.  Most of 
the time when I refer to a move as being a forced move, it means that the move must be played to 
prevent the other player from attaining a killer sequence. Obviously, if there is only one valid move on 
the board it is also a forced move.  Let‚Äôs take a look at a position where one of the players has a 
forced move. 
 
 
 
BLACK TO PLAY

BLACK TO PLAY 
 
In the above position, white is already way ahead on mobility but black isn‚Äôt dead just yet.  While white 
is certainly winning he or she should still have to work to finish off the game if black plays accurately.  
However, black‚Äôs next move is forced.  Black MUST play B1 here.  If black doesn‚Äôt play B1 then white 
will take the edge with G1 next turn.  To understand why, let‚Äôs take a look at what happens if black 
plays a different move.

BLACK PLAYS H6 ‚Äì  WHITE PLAYS G1 
 
If black plays H6 then white responds with G1.  Black is then forced to play G6 next (as it‚Äôs the only 
legal move) to which white responds B1 and then black must play an X-square.  If, in the original 
position, black takes the edge by playing B1, his position isn‚Äôt exactly desirable, but he survives a 
while longer and gives white the opportunity to make a mistake.

In the example, both players can take the north edge with a gain of tempo.  We say that a player has 
gained a tempo when they play a move or a sequence of moves that gain them an additional safe 
move without giving their opponent any new safe moves. Additionally, after white has played to G1,

"Read the following context and answer the question.
Context: move without giving their opponent any new safe moves. Additionally, after white has played to G1, 
B1 becomes a safe move for white and playing B1 doesn‚Äôt create any new safe moves for black.  
Thus white has gained two tempo via this sequence.  Very often, the moves that are the most likely to 
be forced are moves that we have to play in order to prevent our opponent from gaining too many 
tempo.  In fact, there are times when it is possible to win 3 or 4 tempo with proper play!  Let‚Äôs take a 
look at an example. 
 
 
 
BLACK TO PLAY 
BLACK PLAYS C1 
 
 
In this diagram, the move to C1 is the first tempo that is won in a sequence that wins 4 tempo for 
black!  Even if white could somehow pass for the next 3 moves, black would still be in good shape.  
Let‚Äôs take a look at this fictional ‚Äúgame‚Äù where black plays the next 3 moves and uses up all of his or 
her spare tempo.

Another common example of a forced move is when your opponent is threatening to take a corner 
and you have to play a certain move to prevent that from happening.  Let‚Äôs look at an example:

Question: What does the author probably believe about the game of Othello?
Answer:",It is a fun game to play
"In the above picture, while white has many possible moves, white is forced to play A6 even though 
this move flips a lot of black disks and almost eliminates black‚Äôs frontier.  If white doesn‚Äôt take the 
edge, black wins the A1 corner and wins the game convincingly. 
 
From the above examples, it‚Äôs easy to see that a lot of times we will be forced to take edges in order 
to prevent our opponent from gaining enough tempo to run us out of mobility or to prevent them from 
taking corners. 
 
Often, when we‚Äôre looking for a killer sequence, we are looking for a way to win a single tempo 
because if we win a single tempo our opponent runs out of safe moves.

In the example, while white has no safe moves at the moment, every black move gives white more 
safe moves to play. For instance, if black plays F7 then white can safely play to F8.    In fact, if black 
could pass here, he would win because white would be forced to give him the H1 corner. Fortunately, 
black has a forcing sequence that wins a tempo which in many cases is the same as passing.  If black 
plays D1 then white will be forced to play B1 to protect the H1 corner.  Black can then win the game 
by playing F2 forcing white to lose the H1 corner.

Now it‚Äôs time to finish off your opponent with a flourish.  The corners that your opponent had to give 
you are now turning into anchors from which you‚Äôll build your empire.  The first order of business is to 
consolidate to your color as many disks near your corner as possible.  As disks near your corner are 
captured, more and more of them will become stable.  If your position is good enough, you‚Äôll even

"captured, more and more of them will become stable.  If your position is good enough, you‚Äôll even 
have a chance to build in a way that will force your opponent to give you another corner.  After taking 
that second corner, you can consolidate around it as well.   Let‚Äôs look at a quick example: 
 
 
 
STARTING POSITION 
BLACK PLAYS G3 
 
There are several ways to consolidate disks near the H8 corner ‚Äì because the disk at G6 is closer to 
H8 than any of the other white disks, we‚Äôll play G3 ‚Äì which flips that disk in the least disruptive way 
possible.  Notice that D3 would also flip the G6 disk ‚Äì however, after G3, white has 2 options, after 
D3, white has 6 options.  Once your have your opponent under control, its better if you keep them 
under control and limit what they can do.  The more options they have, the more complicated the 
position will become and the more complicated the position is, the easier it is to make a mistake that 
will lose disks.  While black isn‚Äôt in any danger of losing after D3, white may be able to salvage 15-20 
disks if black plays inaccurately.  However, after G3 white is still in danger of being wiped out, even if 
black makes a few minor errors.  It‚Äôs also much easier to calculate ahead when your opponent only 
has one or two options because then you can concentrate on finding your best moves instead of 
having to worry about them fighting back. 
 
After G3, white has 2 options, H3 and H2.  Let‚Äôs look at both:

the northeast corner.  If white plays H2, then black plays C7 and then white is forced to play H3 also 
giving up the corner.  After taking the northeast corner, black will consolidate around that corner as 
well and will have an overwhelming advantage.

Counting and Basic Endgame Theory 
Of course, building is only going to help when you‚Äôre way ahead.  At some point in a closer game you 
have to remember that you want to have the most disks at the end and more importantly the end is 
getting near.  You are trying to keep the number of disks that you have to a small number as 
suggested in the previous sections, right?   
 
Obviously, at the end of the game, keeping your disks to a minimum is not as good of an idea.  You 
have to start playing moves that take a lot of disks.  Usually, in a fairly even game, this is when there 
are about 8 or 10 empty squares on the board.  Unfortunately there‚Äôs no hard or fast rule for when you 
should start taking a lot of disks, however, if you can take a lot of disks and most are stable or they 
make other disks that you have stable, then it is probably a good idea. 
 
 
BLACK TO PLAY 
 
We‚Äôll start with the simple example shown above.  We‚Äôre at the last 2 moves of the game ‚Äì so this 
should be easy. This process of calculating the best play sequence is called counting.  Counting is a 
difficult skill to master and there are many strategies for it.  I prefer to simply employ a plus minus 
count of disks and see which sequence is ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù.
Question: Which of the following is TRUE about the game of Othello?
Answer:",There are many strategies for counting.
"count of disks and see which sequence is ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù. 
 
Let‚Äôs count black‚Äôs move to A1 first.  Black plays A1, that‚Äôs +5 black disks.  White Plays A2 (flipping 
B2), that‚Äôs -1 black disk.  So +5 ‚Äì 1 =  +4 black disks.  The sequence where black plays A1 ends up 
with 4 more disks than in the original position.  That‚Äôs not bad. 
 
Just to be on the safe side, let‚Äôs check and make sure that the move to A2 doesn‚Äôt get more disks.  
Black plays A2 and gets +9 black disks.  White plays A1 and flips B2 and A2, that‚Äôs -2 black disks.  +9 
‚Äì 2 = +7 black disks! 
So, taking the corner in this case is the wrong move.  In fact, if we count the disks currently on the 
board, black has 26 disks.  26 + 4 = 30.  Black loses 30-34 if he takes the corner.  26 + 7 = 33.  Black 
wins 33-31 if he plays A2.  The difference between winning and losing is in understanding why this is 
the case.  For one thing,  the move to A2 simply flips more disks.  With only 1 move left, white can‚Äôt

flip enough of them back to make the corner worth very much.  Remember, the reason that corners 
are important is that they tend to lead to stable disks.  Here, there isn‚Äôt anywhere for white to build off 
of, so the corner isn‚Äôt worth very much.  What we can learn from this fiasco is that rules are meant to 
be broken and that corners become worth less late in the game because there are fewer opportunities
According to the above context, answer the following question.
What is probably true about the author?",They like to play games
"be broken and that corners become worth less late in the game because there are fewer opportunities 
left to build from them. 
 
 
BLACK TO PLAY 
 
In the above example, Black has 3 choices.  Obviously A2 (giving up the corner for no reason) isn‚Äôt 
helpful, so let‚Äôs look at the other 2 options and how they play out.   
 
B1 -  After B1, white is forced to play to B2.  The position after B1 B2 should look familiar because it is 
the position from the previous example!  After B1 B2, Black would play A2, winning 33-31. 
 
B2 ‚Äì This flips 14 disks and many of them become stable. 
If White Plays B1 (-3) ‚Äì Black Plays A1 (+2) then White Plays A2.(-2) ‚Äì  
            +14 -3 +2 -2 = +11 
            If White Plays A2 (-1) then Black Passes 
                                   If White Plays A1 (-5) then Black plays B1 (+3) 
                                   +14 -1 -5 +3 = +11 
                                   If White Plays A2 (-4) then Black Plays A1 (+3) 
 
 
 
+14 -1 -4 +3 = +13 
 
If White Plays A1 (-5) 
 
 
 
If Black Plays B1 (+2) then White Plays A2 (-1) 
                                    +14 -5 +2 -1 = +10 
                                    If Black Plays A2 (+2) then White Plays B1 (-3) 
                                    +14 -5 +2 -3 = +8 
 
After all this calculation, we see that the best sequence after B2 is A1 B1 A2. +10.  In the original 
position, Black has 25 disks.  This means that with perfect play black will win 35-29.  Since 35-29 is

61 
better than 33-31, B2 is the best move for black in the example position.  Clearly being greedy and 
playing B2 and flipping a lot of disks works out well in this position. 
 
 
 
Before we get too greedy and always start playing the move that flips the most disks on the board  
let‚Äôs take a look at the above position. 
 
If Black Plays A1 (+2) ‚Äì White plays A2 (-1) = +1 
If Black Plays A2 (+9) ‚Äì White plays A1 (-10) = -1 
 
Oops! Even though the move to A2 flips more disks, it‚Äôs the wrong move.  By playing to A2, black lets 
white flip all the disks on the A1-H8 diagonal as well as all the new black disks on the A edge. 
 
One of the most difficult parts of Othello is playing proper endgames because at times the right 
sequence is nearly impossible to see without counting every possible variation, and that quickly 
becomes impossible, even for master level players.  Even top human players make endgame errors, 
however, the errors that they make tend to be small (2 or 4 disks) and they tend get a lot of the moves 
right.  On the other hand, I‚Äôve watched games between beginners where both players trade endgame 
errors that are 8 to 10 disks wrong at almost every move. 
 
One important rule we can follow when counting is to know that in almost all cases, if we have a 
sequence in which we get all of the remaining moves, it will probably be the best sequence.

WHITE TO PLAY 
 
If I were to sit down at the above game I would immediately play A1 as white.  After playing A1, black 
is forced to pass.  Then white plays B2 as well.  If white were to play B2 first, black would be able to 
play A1.  If I can get all the disks I would get by playing B2 AND all the disks from playing A1, it has to 
be better than just getting the disks from playing B2 (-2 because black flips the A2 and B2 disks when 
he plays A1).  If we were to sit down and count this position.  We would find out that A1 wins 39-25 
while B2 loses 30-34. 
 
 
BLACK TO PLAY 
 
If I were to sit down at the above game I would immediately play A1, Pass, B1, Pass, H8 and I get all 
3 moves.  Clearly, playing B1 isn‚Äôt good as white just plays A1 and black doesn‚Äôt get the A1-H8 
diagonal.  If black were to play H8 first and then A1 white would just play B1 because the B2 disk 
would get flipped.  Without even bothering to count I know that A1 then B1 then H8 has to be best.
