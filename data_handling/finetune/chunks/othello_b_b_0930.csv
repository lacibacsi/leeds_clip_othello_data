PREFACE
The United States Othello Association (USOA) was created for the advancement of
the game of Othello in the United States. It was begun in 1978 by a group of U.S. Othello
players who had gathered to attend the World Othello Championship (held in New York
City that year). At the time, the Japanese dominated the World Championships (they still
do!) and it was clear to all who attended that the Japanese knew something about Othello
that remained largely a mystery to everyone else. Jonathan Cerf, George Sullivan and the

Article: that remained largely a mystery to everyone else. Jonathan Cerf, George Sullivan and the
rest of the original USOA members set out to discover what that was. They were quite suc-
cessful: Jonathan went on to become the 1980 World Champion, the first non-Japanese
player to do so.
Immediately after its inception, the USOA began the sponsorship of tournaments, es-
pecially the annual U.S. National Championship (the winner of which competes in the
World Championship). The USOA (largely through the efforts of Jonathan and George)
also began publication of Othello Quarterly (OQ) as a means of disseminating informa-
tion about Othello. At the present time, the USOA continues to serve the Othello commu-
nity, maintaining a world wide membership of several hundred players.
I was not one of the original members. However, I had been playing Othello for sever-
al years when I first became aware of and joined the USOA in 1980. By studying articles
in OQ, I set about to change what I discovered to be my largely wrong notions about
Othello strategy. Eventually, I felt I had learned enough to attempt writing an article my-
self. It appeared in the Winter 1980/81 issue of OQ. Over the next several years, I contrib-
uted more than a dozen articles to OQ. Along the way, I also became one of the USOA's
top-rated tournament players.
In 1984, I assumed the Editorship of OQ. That same year, I had the good fortune to
win the U.S. National Championship. I went on to the World Championship, where I

"win the U.S. National Championship. I went on to the World Championship, where I
finished third. With the confidence from my tournament victories and the resources availa-
ble to me as Editor of OQ, I decided that now was an appropriate time to attempt a project
of long-standing interest: to write an introductory handbook on Othello strategy and tac-
tics.
It was clearly something that the USOA needed. It was becoming increasingly diffi-
cult (and unrealistic to expect of new members) to learn the fundamental principles of
Othello strategy by sorting through the ever increasing collection of largely unrelated arti-
cles appearing in the back issues of OQ. A concise, synthesized, easily accessible single
resource was the obvious alternative: a Beginner's Handbook, as it came to be called.
Another potential value of this project would be to serve as an antidote for all the misinfor-
mation about Othello that has been printed in various books over the years. For example, a
recent book describing popular ""indoor games"" had the following to say about Othello: ""It
is not easy to see ahead accurately more than a move or two..."" This is patently false, as the
information presented in this book will demonstrate.
With all this in mind, I began to work on the Beginner's Handbook project. The result
was the original version of ""Othello: Brief & Basic,"" which appeared (starting in Spring
of 1985) as a series of three articles published in separate issues of OQ over the course of a

Article: of 1985) as a series of three articles published in separate issues of OQ over the course of a
year. The issues containing these articles were well received and subsequently became rec-
ommended reading for all new USOA members. There seemed to be sufficient mterest to
justify revising Brief & Basic and combining the three parts into one integrated book.
Thus the revised edition of Othello: Brief & Basic was born.
For this revised edition, I added a table of contents and an index so as to make it easier
to locate particular topics. I also added an appendix containing 11 game transcripts for fur-
ther study and analysis. On the other hand, I chose to eliminate the footnotes of the original
version — most of them references to relevant articles from previous issues of OQ — rather
than have them interrupt the flow of the text. As an alternative, I have included a separate
reference section that contains a listing of almost all of the cited articles.

This is in no way meant to diminish the debt I owe to my fellow authors of OQ arti-
cles. Thus, I again wish to thank George Sullivan, Jonathan Cerf, Amold Kling and the
others without whose writing and insights this Handbook would have taken much longer to
complete (if it ever would have been completed at all). In a more general way, this
Handbook has also benefited from the work of still more people. In particular, I want to ex-
Question: What is the main purpose of the revised edition?
Answer:",To make it easier to find the topics.
"Handbook has also benefited from the work of still more people. In particular, I want to ex-
press my gratitude to Brian Rose, David Shaman and the rest of the USOA's top tourna-
ment players (together with our Othello colleagues in other countries). It has been their
skill and expertise that has ""pushed the envelope"" of what we know about Othello today.
My thanks similarly go to Clarence Hewlett, Dan & Kathe Spracklen, Charlie Heath, Peter
Frey and the other computer programmers whose Othello programs have served as a much
needed source of analytical information, especially in the area of endgame play. As a result
of the efforts of all these individuals, the level of play of tournament Othello in this coun-
try (as well as in the rest of the world!) has improved exponentially over the last 10 years.
Finally, some comments and advice to readers who are approaching Brief & Basic for
the first time. It has been commented that this Handbook is neither as brief nor as basic as
the title would imply. As to its brevity, I can only say that it is considerably shorter than the
more ""complete"" Handbook that I first envisioned. To meet the time and space constraints
of appearing within the pages of OQ, it necessitated that I leave much material out. Rather
than committing myself to a major expansion for this revision, I have maintained this ap-
proach. At times this places an extra burden on the reader. For example, one diagram often

The answer to the above question is","Because it is considerably shorter than the more ""complete"" Handbook that was first envisioned."
"Read the following context and answer the question.
Context: proach. At times this places an extra burden on the reader. For example, one diagram often
serves to illustrate several techniques, where clearly two or three would have made under-
standing the techniques easier. Similarly, there are several explanations of one or two sen-
tences where one or two paragraphs might have helped clarify the matter more. I apologize
for this. My best advice to compensate for these possible weaknesses is - as stated in the
Handbook - to lay out all the diagrammed positions on a board as you read and play out the
moves under discussion.
Another consequence of this emphasis on brevity is that many important ideas are
only mentioned in passing or omitted altogether. Sometimes I comment that a fuller under-
standing would require more space than I could give it. In the worst cases, I become quasi-
mystical and refer to the necessity of practice and experience as a pre-condition for under-
standing. If the reader finds these explanations unsatisfactory, I again apologize. However,
in a few cases (new to this revision), I discuss some of these additional topics in special
sections labelled as ""digressions"" or ""notes.""
As to how ""basic"" the Handbook is: It is certainly basic in the sense that it assumes no
prior knowledge of Othello (other than perhaps a vague idea of the rules of the game).

Article: Even a novice player should be able to follow and implement all of the advice given in this
Handbook. On the other hand, the Handbook does contain a lot of material. The matters
discussed range from the novice level to the expert level. This is not a breezy tutorial than
can be skimmed in a couple of hours. It's probably best if it's studied a few pages at a time,
and always with a board 1n front of you.
The material in Points #1 - #8 should be considered essential for all novice Othello
players to know. Mastering the information in Points #9 - #16 (particularly the concept of
tempo) should result in still a second important leap forward in playing ability. The materi-
al in the remaining points, while representing the greatest technical challenge, is necessary
for anyone hoping to move toward expert level of play.
I have very much enjoyed writing this Handbook. I hope that Othello players, from
novice to expert, will enjoy reading it and will benefit from doing so.

I resigned as Editor of OQ in 1986 and shortly thereafter stopped competing in tour-

Article: response to Brief & Basic. Due to its continued popularity, a second printing has become
necessary. I have taken this opportunity to try(!) to correct all the numerous typographical
errors that had crept into the previous printing. I have also made minor changes to the text
in several places, attempting (yet again!) to improve the clarity of the discussion. Lastly, a
few items have been updated to reflect the events and trends of the past few years.
The world of Othello continues to evolve. The best players today are clearly superior
to their counterparts of just a few years ago. The Japanese remain the dominant force in in-
ternational competition, and the U.S. similarly remains near the top. However, the overall
level of international competition has improved tremendously — with an increasing number
of excellent players emerging from European countries. The game of Othello can only
benefit from these trends. I hope they continue. My hope for Brief & Basic remains un-
changed: that Othello players, wherever they live and from novice to expert, will enjoy
reading this Handbook and will benefit from doing so.

INTRODUCTION
Origins. The origins of the game of Othello remain uncertain, though its similarity to
ancient Oriental games such as Go suggests that Othello may have similar roots. Othello's
modem form emerged in England, in the late 1800's, when Lewis Waterman and John

Article: modem form emerged in England, in the late 1800's, when Lewis Waterman and John
Mollett each separately claimed to have invented the game of Reversi. Though they each
denounced the other as a fraud, they both probably derived their ideas from related pre-
existing games. Reversi remained popular over the next 20 years and then seemed to fade
from view. It resurfaced in Japan, in the early 1970's, when Goro Hasegawa refined the
rules of Reversi, making two significant changes (see below), and called the game Othello.
Othello became very popular during the 1970's, with an annual World Championship be-
gun in 1977 and National Championships held in many countries, including the United
States. The increase in interest in microcomputers in recent years has also contributed to a
resurgence of mterest in Othello/Reversi. This is because the nature of Othello (few rules,
symmetrical board, one type of piece) lends itself to writing computer programs that can
""play"" the game. Dozens of programs, widely varying in quality, now exist that play
Othello. Computer Othello tournaments are held periodically throughout the world.
Equipment. Othello is played on a 8 x 8 ao bcd ie f qgih

Diagram 1
1. A game always begins with four discs placed
as shown in Diagram 1. (This differs from
the rules of Reversi, which allows for any position of the four central discs).
2. One player is assigned Black and always places his discs with the Black side up. The
other player is White, and conversely places his discs with the White side up.
3. Black always goes first with Black and White alternating turns thereafter.
4. A legal move is defined as follows: a new disc is placed on a vacant square. This vacant
square must be adjacent to at least one square already occupied by a disc of the oppo-
nent's color. This new disc must also be placed so that in at least one direction (vertical-
ly, horizontally, or diagonally) the newly-placed disc, together with a disc of the
player's color already on the board, brackets (or ""outflanks"") one or more discs of the
opponent's color. The bracketed disc(s) are turned over (or ""flipped"") to become the
same color as the newly placed disc. If a newly-placed disc outflanks opponent's discs
in several directions at once, all such discs are flipped. For example, all possible legal

Answer:",be placed in a way that it can outflank at least one disc of the opponent's color
"in several directions at once, all such discs are flipped. For example, all possible legal
moves for Black's first turn are indicated with asterisks in Diagram 1 -- each choice
would result in the flipping of one or the other of the two white disks. For an example of
a move that flips more than one disc, turn to Diagram 4 for a moment. Here, a White
move to d7 would flip 4 discs: d4, d5, and d6 vertically and e6 diagonally.
5. A player with no legal moves must ""pass."" For every turn in which a player must pass,
his opponent continues to take turns, taking discs from the other player's ""tray"" as nec-
essary. Thus, (unlike Reversi) a player cannot ""run out"" of discs.
6. A player may not pass if he has a legal move available.
Othello: Brief & Basic 1
7. If neither player has a legal move, the game ends even if there are still vacant squares on
the board. Most often, the game ends when all 64 squares are filled.
8. Once placed on the board, a disc is never moved again, though it may be flipped repeat-
edly over the course of the game. A disc that currently has its white side facing up 1s
called a white disc and vice versa.
Notation & Terminology. In the discussions that follow, the best way to understand
the diagrams is to use a board and discs, laying out and examining the positions discussed
as you go. Diagram | introduces the basics of Othello notation, as used in the diagrams.

"Squares are typically referred to by the letter and number that corresponds to the square, as
indicated along the borders of each diagram. Thus, the second square in the first row is
called the b1 square. Some squares have additional names, as shown in Diagram 1. Thus,
the b1 square 1s also referred to as a C-square. In the case of double diagrams (two grids
with an arrow between): the upper grid shows (1) the board configuration prior to the
move or sequence of moves under discussion (the unnumbered discs) and (2) the move or
sequence of moves under discussion (the numbered discs); the lower grid shows the board
configuration after the move or sequence of moves under discussion has been made. The
numbered discs indicate that you should place discs on the board in the numerical se-
quence shown, flipping the appropriate discs as you do so.
The game of Othello is divided into three phases. The approximate dividing lines are:
Opening: first 20 moves; Midgame: middle 20 moves; Endgame: last 20 moves. Other
important terms will be given in boldface when first mentioned in the sections to follow.
STRATEGY & TACTICS: 21 POINTS
Othello is a game of skill. Luck rarely, if ever, affects the outcome of a game. The
player who can better apply the principles discussed in this handbook will consistently win
against the less well-informed player. Many players remain largely unaware of these prin-
ciples, perhaps because the correct strategy is often subtle and counter-intuitive and there-

Article: ciples, perhaps because the correct strategy is often subtle and counter-intuitive and there-
fore difficult to discover without assistance. These 21 points attempt to provide this assis-
tance.
The right move. The irony of Othello (as well as many other abstract strategy
games) is that even though the entire board and all the pieces are in full view at all times,
the best move is often far from obvious. Deciding upon the ""night"" move can be analogous
to hunting for buried treasure: you need to know (1) what it is you are looking for and (2)
how to go about finding it. These themes wind their way through every point in this book.
For example, Points #4, #5 & #9 focus on the general characteristics of a good move and
the importance of trying to visual the future consequences of a move. Specific suggestions
as to how to recognize good moves in common midgame positions are made in Point #13
and again in #16. The discussions of openings, endgames, and edge play offer other situa-
tion specific recommendations. Point #21 finally deals with the difficult issue of how to
find the best move when (as often happens in real games) several of the ""rules"" discussed
here lead to conflicting or unclear advice. This book will not supply you with all the an-
swers. But it will give you a good head start.

"Read the following article and answer the question.
Article: The object of Othello is to end the game with more discs than your opponent. This
ultimate goal is frequently translated, by many beginning players, into an immediate
goal throughout the game. That is, on each turn, a player will (with few exceptions) take
the move that flips the maximum number of discs. This has been clearly shown to be an
inferior strategy. Actually, disc count is often irrelevant to who is ahead in a game. This
point can not be stated too strongly. In fact, players who consistently flip large numbers
of discs early in the game are among the easiest opponents for experts to defeat! An ex-
2 Othello: Brief & Basic
ample is in Diagram 2. Here, Black has only
one disc on the board, with only four moves
leftin the game. Butif you play the game out, ,
you will find that Black gets all the remain-
ing moves and wins the game 40-24. Clearly,
simply having a lot of discs, even at such a
late point in the game, is not enough to assure
victory. Even games between experts may
end with this sort of turn-around in the last
few moves (though usually not as dramatic as
in this example). The reason this can happen
is that White's disc majority was fragile,
since many of his discs were vulnerable to
being flipped by Black. The point therefore is
not simply to acquire discs, but acquire discs eeeee
that cannot be flipped for the rest of the IAI
game, no matter how the game develops. ' ;

nately, as we will see, stable discs usually
cannot be acquired in any great number until
the endgame. Therefore, the strategy for the
majority of the game focuses on factors other 14
than the relative disc counts of the two
players. These are discussed in the next sev-
eral points.

2. Not All Squares Were Created
Equal
A crucial idea that beginning players in-
evitably realize is the importance of the 4
corner squares on the board. It was not coin-
cidental that the 4 empty squares in Diagram
2 were all corner squares. A corner is im-
portant because it can never be flipped. That
is, itis a stable disc. Similarly, possession of Diagram 3: Black to move
discs adjacent to a commer square (once the
corer has been occupied) often means that
the adjacent discs are stable as well. Thus in
Diagram 3, when Black takes the h8 comer,
all the discs in the g and h columns andinthe  ,
seventh and eighth rows, suddenly become
stable discs for Black. Black is well on the
way to winning the game. In fact, possession
of a comer is so critical in the beginning of
the game, that getting one almost always as-
sures victory. Similarly, since the comers
and the edge squares together add up to 28
squares, it is almost impossible to win with-
out occupying at least some of these squares.
An implied corollary to the above princi-

"out occupying at least some of these squares.
An implied corollary to the above princi-
ples is that squares adjacent to corners are ex-
tremely risky to occupy, at least until the cor-
ner itself has been occupied. This is because
these squares can become ""stepping stones"" ' . '
for your opponent to take the corner. This is Diagram 4: White to move

especially true of the X-squares. Taking an X-square early in the game, usually guaran-
tees that the other player will get the adjacent comer. Such a situation is seen in Dia-
gram 4. Itis White's turn, but no matter where White goes, Black will be able to flip the
disc on the X-square (g7) and take the h8 corner on his next move. Very simply, White
should never have gone to the g7 square at this stage of the game. There are similar
problems with C-squares (see Point #6), though they do not guarantee the opponent's
access to the corner nearly as often as X-squares do.
An incorrect, though commonly assumed, implication of the above discussion is that
all squares on the board can be rated as to their absolute value. In this approach the cor-
ners are typically rated as the most valuable, the A and B edge squares as valuable (but
less so than corners), the non-edge squares (particularly those adjacent to the edge) as
still less valuable, and the C- and X-squares as most risky. By this theory, the best move

Article: still less valuable, and the C- and X-squares as most risky. By this theory, the best move
on each turn usually will be the move that occupies the highest rated square to which
the player has a legal move. Unfortunately, a player adopting this strategy will almost
always be defeated by a player using the winning strategies to be discussed in the next
sections.
[Note: Corners often diminish in value near the end of the game, and corner sacrific-
es become quite common among expert players. In such situations, possession of only
one corner may be sufficient to win the
a_b dae fog ih game. Similarly, occupation of C-squares
ning the game. Examples of these situations
CG
() and even X-squares may be crucial to win-
will be discussed extensively in still later
sections. ]
In summary, the incorrect strategies
place an unwarranted value on flipping large
numbers of discs even though they are not
stable and on possessing the A and B edge
squares. Ironically, the correct strategy typi-
cally involves flipping a minimum number
of discs and often avoiding the non-corner
edge squares, at least until later in the game.
These counter-intuitive ideas, though they
may be difficult for the beginning Othello
player to appreciate, are the key to a winning
Othello strategy! Let's look at these ideas in
more detail:

Article: Square Evaluation
Once understood, the logic of the correct
strategy to winning Othello seems quite
straightforward. Your hope is to get your
opponent to make a poor move that will al-
low you to win the game (e.g. get early ac-
cess to a corner etc.). Obviously, your oppo-
nent, especially if he is a skilled player, is

not likely to make such a move willingly.
C) Your goal, therefore is to force him to make
a poor move. How can this be accom-
eeeoo00 ® plished? Quite simply, if your opponent has
only very few (ideally just one or two) legal
moves, and they are poor moves, then your
opponent will be required (by the rules of
Diagram 6: Black to move
Othello: Brief & Basic
the game) to make a poor move. In the ex-
treme case, where your opponent has only
one move, he is said to have a forced move. ,
An example is given in Diagram 5. Here,
Black wisely chooses to go to e8. The wis-
dom of Black's move quickly becomes evi-
dent: White now has only one move, to b2,
which will allow Black to get the al corner
and inevitably win the game. A slightly
more subtle example of the same principle is
in Diagram 6. Here, if Black moves to g6(!),
White is again forced to the b2 X-square.
Note that any other move for Black (e.g. f6,
g5) opens up new moves for White, thus
eliminating the forced move to b2.
In more general terms, your goal is move

nent has. At the same time you wish to maxi-

will almost certainly win. Another example
ed in Diagrams 7, 8, and 9. In all three dia-
grams, Black is contemplating a move to f8
(an A-square). In Diagram 7, such a move
would be a disaster. It flips the whole f col-
umn to Black, and after a White move to a2,
Black would be forced to go to either b2 or
b7 (X-squares) on his next move, losing ei-
ther the al or a8 comer. In Diagram 8, the
move to f8 is moderately successful, but by
flipping the discs at f6 and f7, it cuts off ac-
cess to other squares (particularly g8) which
could be important later. A move to g4
would probably have been better. Contrast
this to the move to f8 in Diagram 9. Here,
the move does not open up any new moves
for White, while it retains the g8 option for
Black. It is an excellent move in terms of
mobility optimization. In fact, after White-
a2, Black-g8, itis now White who will lose a
corner! The point of all this is that the value
of f8 (or any square) is never an absolute. It
is always a function of the current overall

properly, then an attempt to rate the relative

4. Good Moves and Bad Moves: Gaining Control
What constitutes a good move in Othello? Without reference to specific positions, a
good move can be typically defined in terms of the principles of gaining and maintain-
ing control (with the ultimate aim of acquiring stable discs). That is, a move that in-
creases, maintains or minimally decreases your future mobility while simultaneously
limiting your opponent's mobility is a good move. Unfortunately, applying this princi-
ple to specific positions is often far from a simple matter. Here are some guidelines:
It is technically possible to have control of the game with more discs on the board
than your opponent, with less discs, or with about an equal number of discs. However,
most expert players agree that the easiest way to get control of the game is by maintain-
ing fewer discs than your opponent (1.e. maintaining a low disc count). This is referred
to as evaporation strategy. The rationale for this is that, since your opponent needs to

Answer:",Maintaining fewer discs than your opponent.
"to as evaporation strategy. The rationale for this is that, since your opponent needs to
flip at least one of your discs to make a legal move, the less discs you have on the board,
the less legal moves he is likely to have (i.e. move limitation). Thus, in Diagrams 7-9,
the f8 move in Diagram 7 could be said to be the worst because it flipped the most discs,
while the move to f8 in Diagram 9 was the best because it flipped the least discs. The
advantages of this approach are so great that if one player makes judicious use of evapo-
ration while the other does not, the evaporation strategist will almost always win.
It may be, particularly in a game between two experts, that neither player can estab-
lish a successful evaporation. The game remains roughly even until the endgame. Alter-
natively, one player may succeed in getting control of the game early and acquiring one
or more comers. At these points, evaporation inevitably becomes less important. After
all, at some point you have to start flipping lots of discs or you cannot win the game.
Thus, the value of each square, in terms of the number of stable discs that will be ac-
quired, becomes more important. For this reason, evaporation strategy tends to have de-
creased importance for endgame play.
Similarly, the ultimate goal remains mobility optimization, not simply evaporation.
A move that flips several discs may at times leave your opponent with less options than
According to the above context, answer the following question.
What is the goal of the game?",to get the most stable discs
"A move that flips several discs may at times leave your opponent with less options than
a move that just flips one disc. For example, if most of your discs are centrally located,
while your opponent's discs are spread out along the periphery, you are said to have
""control of the center."" This is generally desirable. Thus, interior squares are typically
better to occupy than peripheral (or frontier) discs. This is because (1) flipping interior
discs generally does not open up as many new moves for your opponent as flipping
frontier discs would, and (2) maintaining a compact center of connected interior discs
tends to lead to more mobility for yourself than having your pieces scattered around the
periphery. A move that flips only interior

be preferable to have your access limited to 2 corner squares rather than to 4 X-squares.
A special type of frontier disc position is called a wall: an area of frontier discs,
along one side of the board, that are of all one color. Generally, it is inadvisable to form
walls. If your opponent should form one, itis generally advisable not to break across the
wall (e.g. move to the unoccupied squares beyond the wall) unless no other viable
moves remain. The potential problems of forming a wall are illustrated in Diagram 10.
Note the relative merits of a Black move to f7 as opposed to e7. The f7 move forms a
wall on the east side of the board, severely limiting Black's future options, while open-
ing up many new moves for White. Quite simply, it is a bad move. The move to e7,
while it flips the same number of discs, is a far better move. The e7 move flips only in-
terior discs, forming a connected, centrally located cluster of discs for Black. The result
(control of the center) is increased mobility (e.g. Black now has access to b4), while f7
is the only new move opened for White.
Note that edge squares are a partial exception to these generalizations about walls

"Note that edge squares are a partial exception to these generalizations about walls
and evaporation: since a player cannot flip past an edge, a ""wall"" of edge squares is not
a liability in the way that a non-edge wall would be. Thus, in Diagram 6, the wall of
Black discs along the south edge did not hurt
Black since they provided no moves for a boc de f go h
White. Still, expert players are often reluc-
tant to take edge squares in the early part of 1
the game. First, taking edges tends to oppose
trying to get control of the center (but see Di-
agram 11 and Point #16). Second, occupied
edge squares often become liabilities later in
the game for a variety of reasons (see Pot
#7 for one major example).

and gain complete control of the game. The sequence of moves results in Black forcing
White to give up the a8 comer. The a7 move, in particular, took away several of White's
options (i.e. d8, g5, and d3). Thus, the advantages of the a7 move become apparent only
if Black anticipates the consequences of the next several moves. For example, the se-
quence of moves would not have ""worked"" if Black's a3 move had flipped White's disc
at b3. This is because it would have prevented Black's subsequent move 27 to a2.
6. Isolated C-square Traps

move towards tactics. Though the dividing line 1s not always clear, strategy tends to fo-

"cus on more general discussions of goals and objectives while tactics refer to more spe-
cific techniques for implementing these goals. For example, in this section we demon-
strate a ""trick"" or a ""trap"" that will force your opponent to concede a corner, no matter
how many moves he might have available at the time. It requires that your opponent oc-
cupy a C-square along an edge that is otherwise empty (or nearly so)(1.e. an isolated C-
square). Actually, this trap will rarely occur in a game between good players, because
they will avoid the positions that would permit it. However, the threat of such traps 1s
often sufficient to constrain your opponent's
h moves. In any case, you need to know of
these traps, if only to avoid falling into them
yourself.
Two examples of this trap are given in
Diagrams 12 and 13. In Diagram 12, Black
followed White's move to gl (the isolated
C-square) with a move to dl. White is now
unable to take any moves along the critical
North edge and so might choose to go to g5,
(for example). Wherever White goes, Black
continues with f1! Now White is forced to
give up the hl corner (.e. White-e1, Black-
h1!). Note how this trap would have failed if
White could have moved to the North edge
(e.g. to el) prior to Black's move to f1. In
. . Diagram 13, White responded to Black's g1

"This is a stronger move than the d1 move in
Diagram 12 since, even if White moves to
h the edge, Black is still guaranteed the h1 cor-
ner (as long as Black maintains access to the
North edge). For example, if White goes to
d1, Black continues with f1. The most com-
plex sequences occur if White avoids the
Cy edge altogether (e.g. by going to g5). If this
occurs, Black continues by going to el.
| Now, once again, White is helpless to pre-
vent the loss of the corner (e.g. White-b6,
Black-f1). If all these seems a bit hard to fol-
low, remember: take out a board, set up the
positions in the Diagrams, and play them
out. I guarantee that all will become clear
shortly.
In summary: you are in danger of suc-
cumbing to these traps only if two precondi-

ponent has access (i.e. legal moves) to the a_t
necessary squares to complete the trap. By 1
avoiding one or both of these preconditions,
you can avoid these traps. The best general
advice is to avoid going to isolated C-
squares altogether. But, as will be seen later,
once an edge begins to fill up (e.g. a C-
square would no longer be ""isolated""), this
prohibition will usually no longer apply.

square trap position. Here, Black can take

7. Unbalanced Edges Diagram 14: Black to move
Earlier, we commented that, despite all
the previous advice, in certain circumstances
going to an X-square can be a good move,
while going to a corner can be a poor one. 1
The ability to recognize these positions is
one of the hallmarks of the more advanced
Othello player. In this section, we discuss
the most basic of these situations: the unbal-
anced edge. An unbalanced edge is defined
as an edge occupied by five adjacent discs of
the same color immediately adjacent to a va-
cant corner. An example is given in Diagram
15. The north edge is unbalanced. Note the
consequences of this position: If Black takes
the X-square at b2, White may indeed follow Te oe
by taking the al comer. But Black can now C)
continue by filling in the wedge at bl (see =
Diagram 16 for resulting position). Now, no Diagram 15: Black to move
matter where White goes, Black now has un-
deniable access to the corner at hl. When
Black does go to h1, the entire row of discs b d
along the north edge (exceptforal) willbe-  ,
come stable discs for Black. In addition,
Black will then be able to gain further stable
discs by going to g2, and continuing to
march down to the h8 corner. If White had
tried to prevent all this by going to b1 initial-

ly Gnstead of a1), this would cause the b2
disc to be flipped to White, and Black will

square move and the resulting corner sacri-
fice clearly worked to Black's advantage
(though if the discs along the east and west
edges had been Black, the advantage would
have been less). Conversely, though there
are numerous exceptions, an unbalanced ' j '

ample that should dispel the myth that edge squares are always good to take). Note that,
given the opportunity, it would usually be to White's advantage to balance the edge
(e.g. go to b1) prior to Black going to b2. Thus, unlike the isolated C-square positions
discussed in Point #6, a C-square move would be considered a good move. However, in
Diagram 15, White could not balance the edge because (since c2 was White) White did
not have access to b1.
But now a note about defense: In situations like the one in Diagram 15, after Black
goes to b2, White's best immediate defense is often to do just about anything except take
Question: When did White's best immediate defense take place?
Answer:",After Black goes to b2
"goes to b2, White's best immediate defense is often to do just about anything except take
the al corner. The idea is to wait (and hope) for the board position to change such that
taking the al corner will no longer be the disastrous move it currently is. For example,
White may hope to force Black to go to g2 (sacrificing the hl corner), before White
goes toal.
Learning the dangers of the unbalanced edge is, however, only the beginning of this
topic. Actually, experts ""take"" unbalanced edges (i.e. make a move that results in the
formation of an unbalanced edge) quite often, and not merely when itis the lesser of al-
ternative evils. Taking an unbalanced edge can be a strong, even a game-winning,
move. This occurs most often in situations where you can prevent your opponent from
getting the wedge necessary to take advan-
tage of the unbalanced edge. Two examples
of this are shown in Diagram 17. First, if
Black goes to b2, White can now balance
the north edge by going to b1 (before going
to al) without flipping the disc at b2. This
will permit White to get both al and b1, de-
feating Black's attack on the edge. A simi-
lar type of problem is seen along the east
edge of Diagram 17. Here if Black tries to
attack the unbalanced edge by going to g7,
White continues with h8. However, Black
will not have legal access to h7 at this point,
giving White the opportunity to go to h7 on
his next move, once again defeating the
Cy threat of the unbalanced edge. In this situa-

Cy threat of the unbalanced edge. In this situa-
tion, Black should delay the g7 move until
Diagram 17: Black to move af possible) a Black disc is securely located
in the seventh row, providing the necessary
access to h7.
Sometimes, an unbalanced edge that
seems safe from an X-square attack may
still be vulnerable to a move along the adja-
cent edge. This is the case in Diagram 18,
where Black's lack of access to b2 prevents
the conventional attack of the unbalanced
north edge. However, Black can go to the C-
square at a2 instead! If White follows by
taking the al corer, Black can successfully
fill in the wedge at bl. If White does not
take the al corner, Black then has the addi-
tional option of going to a7 and eliminating

two diagonals that run from al-h8 and from
Question: What is the name of the game that has a main diagonal?
===
The answer to the above question is",Othello
"The main (or central) diagonals are the
two diagonals that run from al-h8 and from
a8-hl. A player is said to have control of
one of these diagonals when all the pieces
along that diagonal are of his color. There
are numerous ways to take advantage of this
control.
Stoner Traps. A Stoner trap (named
after John Stoner, the first U.S.O.A. member
known to use this trap) is a comer sacrifice/
exchange that depends on main diagonal
control. For example, in Diagram 19, White
can move to b7, gaining control of the a8-h1
main diagonal. As a result, despite White's
X-square disc, Black cannot yet take the a8
comer. Typically, Black will try to move to
a square that cuts across (i.e. flips a disc
along) the main diagonal, so as to gain ac-
cess to a8 (e.g. Black moves to f3). But
White's next move is to d8 (called the ""at-
tack"" square) (see Diagram 20). Now there is
no way to stop White from getting the h8
corer (and most of the south edge as well).
Black cannot go to b8 or he will flip the disc
at b7 and lose both the a8 and h8 corners. If
Black takes the corner at a8, White can then
take h8 directly or even (in this case) take
the wedge at b8 (maintaining access to h8).
If Black avoids both a8 and b8, White still
can go to h8 at any time (an advantage of
this position over a similar unbalanced edge
attack). This exchange of corners is usually
(but not always) favorable to the attacker
since he gets both the edge and a corner,
while his opponent gets only a corner.

to complete the trap (e.g. d8 in Diagrams 19
and 20). For example, White could have
gone to b2 in Diagram 19, attempting a
Stoner trap along the north edge. But this
fails for at least two reasons: after Black

Controlling the Diagonal. If you can
maintain control of a main diagonal, you
can move to the X-squares without allowing
your opponent access to the adjacent cor-
ners. In the endgame, this can be a critical
advantage (even in non-Stoner trap posi-
tions). For example, in Diagram 22, White
can go to b2 and assume control of the a1-h8
diagonal. Black cannot move to al now nor
even move to regain access to al. He is
forced to go to g2 or b7, losing a corner (and
the game as well).
Main diagonals can be so powerful, that
a good player 1s constantly on guard for pos-
sibilities of gaining or losing control of
them, particularly late in the game. Offen-
sively, the player should monitor when he
can take control (or set up to take control) of
a main diagonal. Defensively, the player
needs to be aware of when his opponent
may take effective control of a main diago-
nal, and whether the player then has the
ability to cut across it. Some examples of
these ideas are presented in Diagram 23.

Summary & Preview
In the previous sections, we demonstrated the importance of the four corner squares,
and how a major part of Othello strategy focuses on how to best obtain corners yourself,
while preventing your opponent from domg so. At the same time, we saw several cases
(e.g. unbalanced edges, Stoner traps) where deliberately giving up a comer (typically by
going to an X-square) was a good (even a game-winning) move. Understanding these posi-
tions typically depended on being able to recognize particular board patterns. But more
than that, these positions demonstrated an important principle about Othello. Specifically,
in a typical game between two expert Othello players, one player is rarely able to acquire
all 4 comers. Recognizing this, the critical question becomes not how to prevent your op-
ponent from ever getting a commer, but when 1s the best time (and how is the best way) to
concede a corner. It is almost always better to concede a corner on your terms than to be

Article: concede a corner. It is almost always better to concede a corner on your terms than to be
forced to give up a corner later on your opponent's terms. As comedians are fond of saying:
""It's all in the timing!"" Indeed, many players, even experts, have lost games essentially be-
cause they were too reluctant to give away a corner at an opportune time. On the other
hand, players may also lose games by overlooking unusual ways to force an opponent to
give up a corner (or other positional advantage), ways that work only because the timing or
position is ""right."" The next few sections expand on these fundamental concepts.
9. Gaining and Losing Tempo
A player is said to gain a tempo when he achieves an advantage of timing by deriv-
ing one more viable move than his opponent from play within a limited area of the
board and thereby forcing the opponent to initiate play elsewhere (it is similar to the
concept of sente — or initiative —in Go). Gaining and maintaining a tempo advantage 1s
akey concept in Othello strategy. Let's look at this idea in more detail.
A safe move is loosely defined as a move that is not the proximate cause of giving
your opponent a comer. For example, going to an X-square early in the game is defi-
nitely not a safe move. This definition does not take into consideration the numerous
tres that giving up a corer is a good
move, but it serves us well for the majority
of midgame situations. Typically, as the
board fills up with discs, several distinct re- 1

Context: of midgame situations. Typically, as the
board fills up with discs, several distinct re- 1
gions of empty squares develop. It is useful
to keep track of the number of safe moves
available to you (and to your opponent) in
each of these regions. As play expands to
the periphery of the board, we can initially
conceive of each side of the board as having
10 potentially safe squares (see Diagram
25), though this can change with the board
position. The move to the last safe square
available to either player in a given area of
the board is called the last move (making
the last move of the game a special case of
the ""last move""). Taking a ""last move"" has
the generally desirable effect of forcing Diagram 25: Shaded ogreas
your opponent to initiate play elsewhere on are ""safe move"" regions
the board. If your opponent has no other
safe moves on the board, you are said to have ""run your opponent out of moves""
(causing your opponent to concede a corner) (see also Point #3). Gaining a tempo is of-
ten an effective way to accomplish these goals (see also Point #10).
For example, in Diagram 26, it is White to play. Note that Black has only one safe
move on the board: g5. If White can eliminate this without opening up any more safe
moves, White will gain a comer. White clearly does not want to disturb the North edge

(as this opens up good new moves for
Black) so he will want to go to either h6 or
g5 itself. The h6 move doesn't succeed:
Black simply goes to g5 and White is now
forced to open up the North edge (see Dia-
gram 27). The g5 move is correct: this opens
up a new safe move for Black (h6), but after
Black goes there, White can continue with
h7(!) (Diagram 28). White has now gotten
the last move in that region (via a gain in
tempo) and (in this case) Black is forced to
give up a comer. Whenever you find your-
self with more safe moves than your oppo-
nent (and a means of reducing your oppo-
nent's safe moves), it is worth considering
attempting this. As usual, success depends
upon being able to plan ahead: coming up
one move short of running your opponent
out of moves often spells disaster. Another
word of caution: recall that X-squares are
not always bad moves, and forcing your op-
ponent to concede a corner may not hurt
him. Thus, in Diagram 28, imagine that a7
was vacant. Now after a White move to h7,
Black (though forced to give up a corner)
goes to the b7 X-square, attacking the un-
balanced west edge. In this position, the fi-
nal outcome of the game is no longer clear.
(Note: it is possible to get more than one ex-

Answer:",X-squares are not always bad moves
"nal outcome of the game is no longer clear.
(Note: it is possible to get more than one ex-
tra move in a region -- resulting in a double,
or even triple, gain in tempo!)
A related type of move associated with
tempo is the free move. A free move is a
play that can be deferred until later in the
game and which when taken will not open
up any new safe moves for one's opponent.
It is really a just a special type of safe move
(usually a tempo-gaining last move as well).
White has a potential free move at h7 in Dia-
gram 29. Free moves are like money in the
bank. Don't use them until you need to or un-
til you can make good use of them. Thus, in
Diagram 29, it would be a mistake for White
to take this free move now. Black would
simply respond with c8 and White 1s forced
to open up the North side of the board for
Black (or concede a corner). Instead, White
should play to c8 directly, leading to a likely
b8 response by Black. Now White goes to
h7 and Black is out of safe moves entirely.
Another dramatic example of the power
of free moves is in Diagram 30. Here Black
has two free moves at a2 and a7. Despite
White's possession of three corners, Black is
in control of the game, i the sense that
White not only has no safe moves, he has no

10. Odd and Even Regions of the
Board u
In the previous section we mentioned
how, as the game develops, the board is fre-
quently subdivided in separate regions of
vacant squares. In this section we discuss a
particularly noteworthy aspect of these re-
gions (one that becomes most relevant dur-
ing the endgame): whether there are an odd
or even number of vacant squares in the re-
gion. Most typically, we are referring to re-
gions of two to five empty squares in the
area surrounding a comer. Making the cor-
rect play in these important regions depends
upon an understanding of last move and
tempo (Point #9). For example, let's begin
by looking at the last two moves of the
game.
In Diagram 31, it is Black to play at
move 59. Note Black's dilemma: which ever

In Diagram 31, it is Black to play at
move 59. Note Black's dilemma: which ever
square he takes (h1 or h2), White gets the re-
maining one (i.e. the last move), as well as
securing either the North or the East edge.
This is sufficient to give White the victory.
In situations like this, Black would be happy
to be able to pass. Then, White would have
to go to h2, Black would get the last move at
h1, and Black would win the game. The gen-
eral principle here 1s that White was at an
advantage because Black was forced to
move first into an even-numbered region
(i.e. an area containing an even number of
vacant squares), giving White the last move.

first), giving White an important advantage in the endgame (One major exception to
this is, of course, if there has been a passed move. This, in turn, implies that it would be
to Black's advantage to create an odd number of passed moves. Also see Point #11).

Article: (all other things equal)? This question is still an unresolved debate among expert Othel-
lo players. Most players feel that Black has an advantage in the opening (for reasons to
be discussed in subsequent sections), while White has the advantage (just explained) in
the endgame. Some feel that Black's initial advantage should give him enough of an
edge to compensate for White's endgame advantage. Others disagree. But one thing 1s
certain: we have now strayed too far from our main point. Let's return to it.
The type of situation described above for the last two moves in the game, usually oc-
curs several times earlier in the game as each of the corner regions gets ""filled in."" In
each of these regions, it is typically disadvantageous to move first into an even-
numbered region. Conversely, it is usually advantageous to move first into an odd-
numbered region (for the same reason: this gets you the last move in that region). One
of the surprising corollaries of all this is that it is often advantageous to move into an
odd-numbered region even if it means giving up a corner to do so. Let's look at some
examples.
In Diagram 32, it is White's move, but
Black is in serious trouble. If it were now
aoboic gd é¢ figih Black's turn, Black would be forced to
choose among g7, h2, or h7 (all of which are
disastrous). In order for White to force those
choices on Black, he must gain a tempo
without opening up any new safe moves for
Black. To accomplish this, White needs to

or b8, allowing Black to take the a8 comer.
White then takes the last move in that area
(b7 or b8), gaining a tempo and forcing
Black to make one of the disastrous moves
discussed above. From this position, White
is likely to go on to win the game!
Now that you know the main principle,
Diagram 32: White to move here's the bad news: There are many posi-
tions similar to that shown in Diagram 32
that will not work as well. A good player
needs to be able to distinguish the phony
from the real thing. For example, in Dia-
gram 33, a White move to b7 fails: Black
can safely move to a8, since White will be
unable to follow with b8. Black then gets
the last move in that region (b8) on his next
turn. Meanwhile, White is forced to open up
the North edge, and his momentum 1s lost.
Fortunately for White, a move to b8, in Dia-
gram 33, will work. But change the disc at
c6 (in Diagram 33) to White. Now neither
b7 nor b8 will work (try it!). Other varia-

shown in Diagram 34. Here, Black has con-
trol of the al-h8 main diagonal, with no clear
way for White to cut across it. But White can
take advantage of the odd-numbered region
in the northwest corner area by going to b2.
This forces Black to respond with al (or
White will continue with h8). Now White
goes to a2, gaining undeniable access to h8!
As mentioned above, it is typically disad-
vantageous to move into an even-numbered
region if you are doing so to gain a tempo
(because you and your opponent typically
exchange moves, with your opponent getting
the last move). But there are numerous ex-
ceptions to this too. For example, m Dia-
gram 35, if White moves to b7, Black typi-
cally responds by taking the a8 corner. But
now, White gets both a7 and b8, getting
three (rather than just two) of the four moves
in that region, in addition to the last move. In
fact, a7 and b8 are now free moves, and may
be advantageously deferred until later in the
game. In positions like this, the best defense
for Black is typically to decline the a8 move
as long as possible, hoping for a favorable
change in the board position. Finally, bear in
mind that, despite these exceptions, they re-
main exceptions. The rule still ""works"" most
of the time. [Note: the player with the last

11. Blocking Techniques: Access
and Poisoned Moves
Blocking techniques refer to ways to
prevent your opponent from taking an other-
wise good move. Naturally, you should be
alert both to when you can make such block-
ing moves as well as when your opponent
may be able to block your good move.
Denying Access. Numerous times in the
preceding discussions we have used the term
access. For example, it was a key concept to
understanding control of the main diagonals
(Point #8). Now itis time to examine it more
formally. Quite simply, you are said to have
access to a particular square if you can legal-
ly go there. A lack of access to a particular
square is a type of block, and often a quite
frustrating one. Thus, In Diagram 36, White
would easily win the game if he could sim-
ply go to b8. But he can't, and so he must go
to g2 or g7 instead, losing the game.

"18
An expert Othello player does more than
hope to avoid these situations (or find his
opponent in them), he works to accomplish
these goals. In particular, he watches the
board so as to maintainhis own access to
critical squares while similarly denying ac-
cess to his opponent's critical squares. Let's
consider some other examples.
In Diagram 37, Black is concerned that
White may eventually find it desirable to at-
tack his unbalanced edge by going to g7.
Seeking to prevent this, Black goes to bS.
The unique advantage of this move over oth-
er acceptable moves (e.g. c2 or d1), is that it
flips the disc at g5 to Black. Now White no
longer has access to g7 and Black's unbal-
anced edge is relatively safe. Later in the
game, a naive White may feel that he was
simply ""unlucky"" not to have access to 97,
but it was actually Black's foresight that was
responsible. In Diagram 38, Black wants to
block White's future access to the a8 corner
region. Black can effect this by moving to
e8. This pressures White to respond with d8
(otherwise Black would go there on his next
tum, and gain a tempo). But White's d8
move flips the Black discs at b6 and c7 to
White, sealing-off the region to White. The
potential weakness of a sealed-off corner
area is clearly shown in Diagram 39. Here
White is sealed-off from the odd-numbered
region surrounding the al corner. Black
takes advantage of this by going to g8 (ae.
moving into the only other odd-numbered
region on the board). This, in effect, shifts
According to the above context, answer the following question.
What is the purpose of the passage?",to describe the rules of Othello
"moving into the only other odd-numbered
region on the board). This, in effect, shifts
the ""last move"" advantage (discussed in
Point #10) from White to Black. Thus, be-
cause White cannot go to the al comer area
(e.g. a2 would have been a game-winning
move!), White must now give a comer and
lose the game. Indeed, Black (with proper
play) can now get the last move in each of
the 4 corner regions.
Finally, it is worth noting that denial of
access is just another perspective on the ma-
jor principles of move limitation and ""run-
ning your opponent out of moves"" etc. that
have been discussed previously. For exam-
ple, determine what move you would make
as White in Diagram 40. The critical obser-
vation is that Black currently has only one
safe move: e8. If you can take it away with-
out opening up any new safe moves, Black
will be forced to concede a corner. Taking
e8 itself doesn't work: Black continues with
b8. The move that succeeds is a6! You have

the Black disc at c6. Black must now make
what is likely to be a game-losing move. 1
Poisoned moves. A poisoned move is
another type of blocking move. Actually it is
like a ""semi-denial"" of access: you do not le-
gally prevent the opponent from moving to a
square; you simply make it undesirable to do
so. Technically, a poisoned move 1s defined
as a move that cannot be made without flip-
ping unwanted discs. As was true for deny-

Article: as a move that cannot be made without flip-
ping unwanted discs. As was true for deny-
ing access, the good Othello player actively
searches for opportunities to make this type
of move. Thus, in Diagram 41, White has
two apparently good moves, a7 and f2 (e.g.
neither move opens up any new safe moves
for Black). However, White should avoid the
a7 move for the moment, preferring the f2
move. This is because Black currently has a
good move at f8. But after White moves to
f2, the f8 move becomes poisoned (ie. it 1
would flip all the White discs in the f col-
umn, creating an undesirable wall for = C)
Black).
[A slight digression: One reason why oc- 3 IC Wee
cupying edge squares is often thought of as
undesirable is that they tend to poison other- 4 eee
wise good moves. Thus in Diagram 42, 5 SS. 8
Black is considering the reasonably good
move to g4: it only flips one disc (f5) with- ell) eee
out any great benefits to White's mobility.
However, consider the consequences of the f eo
g4 move if Black takes it after first goingto ry =
the cl edge square (with a probable a2 White
response). Now, because of the new Black Diagram 41: White ta move
edge pieces, the g4 move will flip both e2
and f3 as well as g4. This opens up the f2
move to White. The g4 move no longer a oboe
looks as desirable. It is said to have been
self-poisoned. Thus, the timing (i.e. the se- 1 (>
quence of moves) is critical: if you wish to

though frequently resulting from edge
square moves, can occur as a result of any
type of move. A related concept is ""unpoi-
soning"": changing a currently undesirable
move for an opponent into a desirable one by
flipping a disc that was acting to poison the
opponent's move. Typically, you wish to
avoid unpoisoning opponent's moves. Thus,
again in Diagram 42, a Black move to h6
should probably be avoided: it unpoisons the
White move to a6 by flipping the poisoning Diagram 42; Black to move

While we're on the subject, note how
White's moves along the South edge are pot-
soned by White's discs along the West edge
and East side of the board. ]
Still another way to block an opponent
from taking a desirable move is to take it
yourself. This is obviously a good alterna-
tive if such a move would be a good one for
you anyway. Yet sometimes, this type of
block can be effective despite initial appear-
ances to the contrary. For example, in Dia-
gram 43, about the only way that White can

Article: ances to the contrary. For example, in Dia-
gram 43, about the only way that White can
permanently prevent Black's good move to
f3 is to take it himself. However, White may
be reluctant to do this because it also flips
the Black discs at f4 and f5, creating a White
wall along the east side. None-the less, the
move works out well for White: no matter
where Black goes next, White can eventual-
ly get the excellent move to e6, and the pres-
sure is now on Black.
In summary, when your opponent has a
good move, there are generally three things
you can do to prevent it: a) deny access to
the move, b) poison the move, or c) take the
move yourself. Of course, if you have more
than enough good moves yourself, you may
simply choose to ignore your opponent's
good move altogether. If more than one of
these alternatives is possible, the best one
can only be determined (surprise!) by exam-
ining the overall board position (see also
Point #15).
12. The Semi-Forcing Move
A semi-forced move is a move which is
forced not by the rules of the game, but rath-
er by tactical considerations. In practice, the
""tactical consideration"" is most often that,
unless the player takes the semi-forced
move, he will lose a corner. The opponent's
move that puts a player in this position is
called the semi-forcing move. Proper use of
semi-forcing moves can be a powerful tech-
nique, and really we have already seen sev-
eral examples of it. Thus, the e8 move in Di-
agram 38 (though it did not directly threaten

"Read the following article and answer the question.
Article: eral examples of it. Thus, the e8 move in Di-
agram 38 (though it did not directly threaten
a comer) semi-forced a d8 response, sealing
White off from the southwest corner area.
Let's look at a few more examples.
In Diagram 44, White would have a great
move to f7, if it was not poisoned by his
discs at f1 and f2. White can set this up by
first moving to el, semi-forcing a g1 reply
Othello: Brief & Basic
by Black (and flipping the critical f1 and f2 discs). Now White continues with f7 and
Black must sacrifice a corner, and the game!
In Diagram 45, Black would like to block White's access to b1. He can do this by
moving to a3. This semi-forces an a4 reply, which in turn flips the c2 disc to White, pre-
venting White from balancing the edge. Having accomplished this, Black has another
semi-forcing move available that is probably even better: go to h5 (adjacent to White's
uneven three). This semi-forces White to respond with h6, flipping the Black discs in
the sixth row to White (sharply reducing White's future mobility).
13. Mobility Reconsidered
With the perspective of our most recent discussions, let's now re-examine some 1s-
sues related to the all-important principle of mobility optimization (see Points #3 & 4).
Regional Mobility. In some situations, there may be several safe moves that all flip
about the same amount of discs. A strict application of evaporation techniques suggest
they should be about equally good moves. How do you decide between them?
Question: The passage is mainly about   _  .
Answer:",how to play Othello well
"Read the following context and answer the question.
Context: they should be about equally good moves. How do you decide between them?
One idea, previously discussed, is to prefer the move that flips more interior discs.
But what if (as is more common) all your choices are about equal in this respect as well?
Here you should still be guided by the idea that you want to open up as few new safe
moves for your opponent as possible. One general rule is (almost paradoxically) take
the move that is in the area where your opponent already has the most amount of poten-
tial moves (i.e. the area of greatest regional mobility). The logic is that discs flipped in
this region will only minimally increase your opponent's mobility since they will tend to
provide access to squares that the opponent already has access to. Another way of stat-
ing this same rule is: move to the area where your own mobility is the most limited. The
hope is to lure play into this area, getting your opponent to use up all his safe moves
there, thereby eliminating his regional advantage.
One example is in Diagram 46, where it is White to move. Let's consider the vari-
ous possibilities. Clearly, a move like f3 would be undesirable, flipping seven discs
(mostly along the frontier), and severely lim-
iting White's future mobility. A move to g3
may seem initially to be a good move as it a_eb
only flips one black disc. However, Black's
mobility in this eastern region is currently
zero and any move in this area would have
the negative effect of “opening up"" the area
Question: What is probably true about the writer?
Answer:",He likes to play games
"zero and any move in this area would have
the negative effect of “opening up"" the area
to Black (e.g. after g3, Black could move to
f3 and be set up for a further move to h3).
Generally better is to move into the area
where Black already has some mobility: the
western edge of the board in this case. For
example, a move to a6 does not open up any
new moves for Black! Note that not all
moves in this western region are necessarily
equal. For example, compare the a6 move to
another similar, though less desirable, move
to b6. The b6 move, by flipping both the
discs at b5 and c5, totally shuts off the region
to White, while the a6 move only ""picks off""
(i.e. flips) the b5 disc, leaving the c5 disc for a possible White move to b6 on his next
turn.
Sometimes, if you can see ahead a sufficient number of moves, you may realize
that after all the exchanges of moves in an open region, your opponent will get the last
move and you will be forced to open up a closed (to your opponent) region anyway (e.g.
east region is closed to Black in Diagram 46). In such cases, it may pay to move to the

The answer to the above question is",because it's better

the board position (see also Point #16 (dou-

Checkerboarding. Sometimes, particu-
larly in some opening positions, the best way
to mimimize your opponent's options is with
the opposite of evaporation: obtaining a vast
majority of discs rather than a minimum.
This is especially true if you can leave your
opponent's discs scattered along the frontier
where they tend to block each other's moves
(called checkerboarding your opponent).
The goal here is to force your opponent to
make a bad move before he can regain con-
trol of the center and attack your suddenly
vulnerable position. One example is in Dia-
gram 47. Here White's surprise moves, at 8
and 10, leave Black with only two discs. But
note that except for a move to h4 (which
White can counter with h6), all of Black's
possible moves flip at least three (mostly
frontier) discs. White is really in fairly good
shape here. If you find yourself checker-
boarded, the general advice is either to wait
it out as long as possible (by taking moves
like h4), hoping for your opponent to col-
lapse under his own vast disc majority, or to
find a move that quickly reestablishes con-
trol of the center without creating too many
other liabilities (such as possibly f3 in Dia-
gram 47).

Article: gram 47).
A technique, related to checkerboard-
ing, is to keep your opponent's disc count so
low that he is threatened with a wipe-out
(i.e. reducing your opponent's disc count to
zero whereby you instantly win the game).
Even if the wipe-out attempt fails, the threat
of it can sometimes force your opponent into
an awkward position. For example in Dia-
gram 48, it may seem like c2 1s White's best
move, but actually f7 is the winning move.
This reduces Black to only one disc (at d2).
More importantly, wherever Black now
moves (except g2), White will be able to
achieve a wipe-out on his next turn. Of
course, after Black takes g2, White will fol-
low by taking the h1 comer and is still head-
ed for victory. To protect against this, Black
needed to watch for the danger of being left
with only one or two pieces that are sur-
rounded by opponent's discs. However, there
is a more-or-less permanent way to elimi-

piece is called an ""anchor."" For example, imagine that there is a White disc at b4 in Di-
agram 48. Now, White's move to f7 fails to work: Black can take the edge anchor at a5,
the wipe-out threat is gone, and itis White who is in serious trouble.

Now, we shift our attention to aspects of Othello that are specific to the three different
phases of the game. Most of what we have discussed thus far bears primarily on the mid-
game. The extreme beginning and end of the game are special cases and deserve special
consideration. We will focus on them (as well as one additional aspect of midgame strate-
gy) in the next several points. Some of this discussion will be a repetition of material cov-
ered in previous points, except now the focus will be on a particular phase of the game.
14. The Opening: The Three Basic Variations
There is a feeling, among many Othello players, that generalizations of strategy
have such limited applicability in the opening, as to be practically useless. In particular,
with so few discs on the board, positions are too volatile and relative advantages too
easily shifted to currently visualize a move's ultimate worth. Thus, there are no immedi-
ate goals in the opening (according to this viewpoint); one simply avoids major blun-
ders and hopes that an advantageous midgame position (in terms of mobility etc.) will
result. In my opinion, this is only partially true. Some ideas about strategy and tactics in
the opening can be forcefully made (see Point #15). At the same time, as in games like

The answer to the above question is",He believes there are some ideas that can be made.
"Read the following article and answer the question.
Article: the opening can be forcefully made (see Point #15). At the same time, as in games like
chess, it will also be useful to develop an ""opening book"" (1.e. a collection of prepared,
memorized sequences of opening moves that are followed primarily because previous
experience has shown them to work well). All expert players have at least a limited
opening book. There is also some general agreement about which are the better open-
ings (with the result that some openings occur quite frequently, while others do not oc-
cur at all).
Some players limit their opening books to the first 6-8 moves, relying on their gener-
al knowledge about Othello to carry them from that pomt. Other players have an exten-
sive collection of potential openings (tediously prepared!), often reaching to move 20
and beyond. The success of these longer prepared openings depends upon many things,
not the least of which is the ability to anticipate an opponent's likely responses (e.g.
there is no point in preparing an opening sequence to counteract a move that no oppo-
nent will ever make!). Despite the difficulties in preparing these longer openings, I be-
lieve they are worth the effort. First, it allows you to make moves ""automatically,"" sav-
ing time on your clock (which is important in tournaments, where you typically have 30
minutes or less to make all your moves). Second, you will frequently gain an opening
advantage over a less prepared oppponent; this alone may be sufficient to give you the
Question: The author thinks that   _  .
Answer:",longer prepared openings are worth the effort
"advantage over a less prepared oppponent; this alone may be sufficient to give you the
edge needed to win the game!
However, a beginning player is not likely to have the skill necessary to develop
openings on his own. Until such skills are acquired, the best course for such a player 1s
to study (and memorize) the openings already used by expert players. There 1s not suffi-
cient space in this Handbook to detail even close to a majority of these expert openings.
However, we can discuss some of the most common sequences in the first 8-10 moves.
Transcripts of games from tournaments (as regularly published in OQ) are particularly
good sources of further ideas about openings. As you gain experience, you will hopeful-
ly develop the ability to expand upon and add to these openings.
The first point about openings is that Black's first move 1s not really a choice at all.
That is, all 4 of Black's potential first moves are either a rotation or a mirror image of
each other. It is White that makes the first move that affects the course of the game. So,
for simplicity, let's assume Black's first move is always to c4. White now has three

Openings, respectively (see Diagram 49).
Let's examine each of these three basic vari-
ations in turn.
The Diagonal Opening. For most of the
1970's and into the 1980's, the Diagonal
Opening was by far the most preferred
among experts in the U.S. (as well as in Ja-
pan — the country that has won more World
Championships than all other countries com-
bined!). The position after the most common
sequence for the first four moves (1. c4, 2.
c3, 3. d3, 4. c5) is shown in Diagram 50.
This is a critical point in this opening, in that
Black now has 9 squares from which to
choose (In fact, it is this mobility for Black
that has led many players to abandon this
opening as White). The most common con-
tinuation for Black at move 5 is d6, typically
followed by 6. f4, 7. £5 (see resulting posi-
tion in Diagram 51). Common further con-
tinuations include 8. e6, 9. c6, 10. d7 (Maru-
oka Opening); 8. d2, 9. g4, 10. d7
(sometimes called the Tanida Opening). An-
other variation after 5. d6 is: 6. e3 (called the
""chimney"" because of the resulting position,
seen inverted in Diagram 52), typically fol-
lowed by 7. £5, 8. c6. Despite's White's over-
whelming disc majority after move 6. e3, ex-
perience has shown this to be a viable
opening. Of the other variations at move 5,
the most common are 5. b4 (Heath Opening;
see Point #16) and 5. f6 (which typically de-
velops into 6. e3, 7. c6, 8. d6, 9. e6; also see

The Perpendicular Opening. This has
been the most popular opening in the U.S. in
recent years — though the diagonal opening
now seems to be gaining favor again. The
most common first 6 moves are 1. c4, 2. 63,

typically followed by 4. e6 with 5. f6, 5. f4,
or 5. d3 all possible continuations.

Article: rection of the opening because of the uncer-
tainty of what your opponent may do. A good
player must be prepared to defend against
most of the openings his opponent is likely to
use. But beyond this, how do you decide
which of the recommended openings to play
and which to avoid (if possible)? There is no
easy answer to this. Different openings lend
themselves to different styles of play; often
the best opening for you is the one that
""feels"" the most comfortable. Alternatively,
you may choose to study a particular opening
and then use it simply because you know it so
well.
Finally, all this doesn't mean that there 1s
no way to understand what makes a good vs.
a bad opening move (other than trial-and-
error). There is the important principle of the
""quiet move,"" our next point!
15. The Opening: Quiet Moves
In the game of billiards, a player some-
times finds himself without a viable shot at
getting a ball in a pocket. In such cases, the
player often will attempt a shot that disturbs
the table as little as possible. The idea is to
leave his opponent with the same poor posi-
tion. This is actually quite similar to the ma-
jor goal of the opening phase of Othello.
Players frequently find themselves in the po-
sition that anything they do only make their
position worse. Their ideal move would be to
pass, but they can't. So they attempt to ""dis-
turb"" the board as little as possible, typically
by trying to flip only one disc, preferably an

"turb"" the board as little as possible, typically
by trying to flip only one disc, preferably an
interior one. These types of moves are called
quiet moves.
Othello expert Arnold Kling has gone one
step further and defined the ""perfectly quiet
move"" (PQM): a move that creates only one
new frontier (1.e. perimeter) disc — the one
used to make the move. An example of a

h PQM is the move to d3 in Diagram 54. It is
the only PQM that Black currently has avail-
able. PQMs help to keep your frontier disc
count low as well as keep your discs com-
pact and centrally located (both desirable
() goals as the opening progresses). The major-
ity of moves in most openings can be under-
stood in terms of taking a PQM, setting up to
take a PQM (set-up or offensive move), or
blocking your opponent from taking a PQM
(block or defensive move).
Examples of both a set-up and a block are
in Diagram 55. Here a Black move to d3
sets-up a PQM to f5 on Black's next turn.
White may block this by going to c2 (deny-
ing Black access to f5). Black is likely to

set-up is possible in Diagram 54: note that f6
abe de would be a PQM for Black if the White disc
at e6 was Black. Black can accomplish this
by going to d7, for example, setting up a
POM at f6 for his next turn (which White
might try temporarily to block by going to
c3!). PQMs are so powerful that moves that
would normally not be desirable become
good if they can set-up or block a PQM. For
example, in Diagram 56, a White move 18 to
e6 is preferable to 18. £3, because the f3
move allows Black to continue with 19. e6 (a
PQM). Similarly, after 18. e6, Black may
C) continue with 19. dl, a move whose major
virtue is that it sets-up a PQM at b6. To
block this PQM, White is likely to follow
Diagram 56: White to move with a4 (poisoning the b6 move). One further
implication of all this is that you should al-
most always avoid moves that create a PQM
for your opponent where one previously did not exist. Otherwise you give your oppo-
nent a very easy decision for his next move (i.e. a reflex move): he takes the PQM!
(Note the similarity of all these principles to the more general discussion of blocking
techniques covered in Point #11).
Not all opening moves revolve around PQMs. An opening move may be desirable
because it cuts across the center and re-establishes a compact central cluster of discs
(perhaps leaving the opponent scattered about the frontier as well). Such moves may be

"(perhaps leaving the opponent scattered about the frontier as well). Such moves may be
advised even though they typically flip more discs than conventional evaporation strate-
gy would recommend (e.g. checkerboarding, as discussed in Point #13). Also moves
that just flip one or two frontier discs (typically called waiting moves) are occasionally
desirable. For example, note moves 8, 9, and 10 of the Tanida Opening (see Diagram
51). These moves can be good because they generally avoid setting-up PQMs for your
opponent and may initiate a process of running your opponent out of moves. However,
they risk interfering with getting control of the center and may even help your opponent
to do so (see also Points #13 and #16 for more on these topics).
Finally, a comment on two commonly held beliefs about openings: 1) Black has the
advantage in the opening. This is difficult to prove, but seems to be true. In particular,
all other things equal, Black seems to have an easier time maintaining control of the
center and a lower disc count than does White. 2) You should not move out of the

16. Midgame Strategy: Patterns
We have already discussed a great deal about midgame strategy. Evaporation, unbal-
anced edges, tempo gains etc. all have their greatest relevance in the midgame. Howev-
er, in an actual game, it may not always be easy to apply these principles. Once again,
we return to the issue of how to determine a ""good move."" In many cases, a global view
of the midgame can assist in your decision making. This can be best achieved by view-
ing the board position as one of several possible patterns. Not all midgames will fit one
of these patterns, but many of them will. Some patterns are ""even"" — others are one-
sided. In either case, recognizing the pattern can be a guide as to what move to make
next. But be especially careful: these patterns are transient! One or two moves can
transform the board from one type of pattern to another. In fact, the major goal of cer-
tain moves may be to effect a change to a more favorable pattern.
The Sandwich. This describes a pattern
where one player's pieces are surrounded on
two sides by opponent's pieces (see Dia- 1
gram 57). This is a one-sided position: the
player with the inside position (Black in Di-
agram 57) is generally considered to be
ahead. If he can get White to surround him
on more than two sides, he will be firmly in

"ahead. If he can get White to surround him
on more than two sides, he will be firmly in
control of the game and on his way to forc-
ing a win. In Diagram 57, Black is likely to
take the PQM at b6, maintaining the sand-
wich. Typically, White's best strategy here
is to make waiting type moves, squeezing
out every last option for a move, hoping to
force Black out of the sandwich before the
situation becomes hopeless. In this case,
White may go to b3, which leaves Black  Uiagram 37: Black to move

yourself on the inside of a sandwich too of-

that the overall position resembles an X
(with each player having one line of the X)

so each player will generally attempt to
maintain the X, hoping to force the other
player into a move that erodes the position.

back and forth, and only minimally disturbing the periphery. Aside from such moves
being good from a general perspective (e.g. avoiding walls, flipping few frontier discs
etc.), bisecting your opponent's pieces tends to shift the X position towards a favorable
sandwich position. The opponent must do his best to counteract this on his next turn.
Thus (in Diagram 58) White is liklely to go to g6, while Black is likely to continue with
c7. If neither player gets a clear advantage, the outcome will be decided in the endgame,
after the edges start to fill up (and the X-pattern typically begins to look more like a
cross pattern).
[A slight digression: White might possibly choose to go to c7 rather than g6, taking
away Black's expected c7 response. This would pressure Black to consider a move to
d1, blocking (at least temporarily) White's ability to take g6 on his next move. This rap-
idly develops into a very different type of game than if White had started with g6.]
The Double Wall. Despite the admonition against forming walls, a wall can be de-
sirable if it pressures your opponent to form one as well. This leads to a double wall (Di-
agram 59). This is generally an even position, at least as long as the double wall is main-
tained. The goal, of course, is to get your opponent to break across and erode your wall
before you must do so to his wall. This typically requires making waiting type moves
Question: What is probably true about the author?
Answer:",They are an expert at chess
"Read the following article and answer the question.
Article: before you must do so to his wall. This typically requires making waiting type moves
(using up as few options as possible with each move), creating an ever more extensive
wall as you do so. Thus, White may go to e7,
h with Black continuing to e8 (not f8, which
allows a d8 response by White), each player
moving so as to extend his own wall.
The risk here is that, if you fail in your
goal, you may quickly find yourself in a
hopeless position. So sometimes, if you can
perceive that you will lose the double wall
battle, it pays to cut across your opponent's
wall immediately. Typically, you would try
to cut through the wall in a way that mini-
mizes your opponent's gain in options, while
attempting to shift towards a favorable sand-
wich position. Thus, after White e7, a Black
move to g3 has considerable merit: the only
new safe move it gives White is h4.

able moves remain (or unless doing so forces
your opponent into making a even poorer
move). For example, imagine White moved

The Edge Double Wall. This is a special 1
pattern that seems to contradict much of the
conventional wisdom of Othello. In particu-
lar, one player (called the initiating player)
typically gives up control of the center, go-
ing to the edge early and often. The result is
frequently a sort of double wall, except one
player (the initiator of the pattern) typically
has his wall along two edges, while the op-
ponent's pieces are all in the interior of the
board (see Diagram 61). In such a position, ry
the player with the edge pieces is said to try
to ""creep along the edge"" (i.c. take a series ry  )
of contiguous edge moves while keeping his
opponent off the edges; also see Diagram Diagram 61: Blac
11). If successful, the initiating player soon
runs the opponent out of safe moves (.e. op-

be forced to concede a corner. Thus, in Dia- 1
gram 61, Black goes to h7, leaving White
with only one safe move at c7. Black then
continues with c8, and White is forced to
concede a comer (and probably the game).
However, this ""creeping"" strategy carries
extreme risks: if the opponent can hold on,
without running out of options, until the mid-
game (or even later), the initiating player's
long edge walls and lack of central discs will
collapse on him as his opponent's more con-
ventional advantages finally turn the tide.
Thus, in Diagram 62, Black failed in his
edge double wall attempt. He must now start
making moves across White's wall, giving Diagram 62: Black to move
White new safe moves, and greatly deterio-
rating Black's position. As alluded to in
Points #14 and #15, the Heath opening (because of its early exit from the sweet six-
teen) is noted for Black initiating an edge double wall.

Checkerboards. Though checkerboarding patterns (see Point #13) are most fre-
quently seen in the opening, they may occasionally persist to the midgame. Here, the in-

"periphery (checkerboarded). Ironically, in the midgame, it is typically the initiator who
will go on to lose the game. This is because it is usually too difficult to force the check-
erboarded player into a game-losing move before the initiator's position hopelessly de-
teriorates. Thus, the midgame checkerboard is usually reserved for desperate positions,
where all other options seem even worse.
In summary, while all these patterns hold true to many of the basic concepts of
Othello strategy discussed previously, the exact subgoals can vary dramatically from
pattern to pattern. In addition, within a pattern, the correct subgoal may vary depending
upon whether you are on the offensive (e.g. initiator) or defensive side of the pattern.
Knowing how to handle each type of pattern is critical to successful midgame play.

Previous sections have emphasized the principle of evaporation: how the best move
of the game is often the one that flips the least amount of discs (see Points #1-#5 for re-
view). But clearly, this has to come to an end at some point - after all the objective of
Othello is to finish the game with the most
fa h amount of discs. So now, we have arrived at
our discussion of the endgame. Clearly, with
OW only a few moves left, now is the time to go
for broke and flip as many discs as you can,
 S right? Well, it's almost right. The idea is not
necessarily to flip the most amount of discs
on each turn, but to flip the most amount of
discs relative to your opponent. The differ-
ence can be seen in Diagram 63. Here it is
Black to play at move 59. The move to the
h1 corner flips 8 discs while the alternative
move to h2 only flips 2 discs. But even at
this late stage of the game, assuming that
this makes hl the better move for Black

"and winning the game 33-31. If Black had
gone to h2 mstead of hl, White then takes
h1, flipping only 1 disc, and Black wins 34-30. Clearly what is needed is an ability to
count the position: determine the net gain or loss of discs for all the remaining possible
sequence of moves.
There are many possible ways to count discs, and even the experts disagree as to the
best way. Here, I will present one method of counting that could have guided you to the
best move in Diagram 63. Consider first the hl move: Black flips eight discs (+8) and in
addition places down 1 new disc (+1) for a gain of +9 (1.e. 8 +1). White continues by
flipping 10 black discs back to white for a loss (for Black) of —10. The result is (+9) + GC
10) = -1, or a net loss of 1 disc for Black. Compare this to the result if Black takes h2
first: Now Black flips 2 discs plus adds a new disc to the board (+3), while White flips
only 1 black disc when he goes to h1 (-1) for a net result of (+3) + 1) = +2. Since +2 is
a better final result than —1, then h2 is a better move for Black than h1.
Clearly, with more moves remaining (and with more choices at each move and discs
possibly getting flipped back and forth several times before the game is over), determin-
ing the best move by counting can be extremely difficult, if not impossible. This 1s what
makes the endgame such a humbling experience for human Othello players. Computers

of the game, analyzing all possible permutations in a relatively brief amount of time, de-
termining all final disc counts, and picking the move that guarantees the highest possi-
ble disc count against best possible play (.e. the perfect play sequence). Essentially,
the computer is no longer using any of the heuristic strategies 1t must employ earlier in
the game. It simply uses the final disc count to determine its best move. If humans could
do this as well (in the time constraints of a tournament and without being permitted to
write down anything!) then this would be the recommended strategy for human players.
But humans can rarely count out a game with more than 5 moves left, and even then the
count is usually incomplete, limited only to those sequences the player thinks are most
likely to occur. So, we humans have to rely on strategic generalizations to help us
through most of the endgame (see also Point #18). But, whenever feasible, counting
should be attempted.
For example, in Diagram 64, though there are just three moves left, only careful
counting is likely to reveal the best move. The current score is Black(35)—White(26).
White can choose from any of the three remaining squares for his next move. Taking
Question: What does the computer use to determine the best move?
Answer:",The final disc count
"Read the following article and answer the question.
Article: White can choose from any of the three remaining squares for his next move. Taking
the hl corner immediately may initially seem attractive. Indeed, if Black follows with
h2, White goes to g1 and wins 34-30 (e.g. +3-3+8 = +8). But h2 is not Black's best re-
sponse and White should not count on Black going there. If Black goes to g1 instead,
White finishes with h2 and loses 31-33 (+3-—
5+7 = +5). If White chooses h2 initially,
Black must pass. White's best continuation
turns out to be g1(!), but after Black finishes
with h1, it still only nets White a tie (+6+7-7
= +6). Only an initial move to g1 guarantees
a win for White. Black's best response is h1,
leaving h2 for White and a 33-31 win (+7—
7+7 = +7). In this case, where strategic gen-
eralizations offered little help, correct count-
ing was critical: it meant the difference be-
tween victory and defeat.
Of course, in many endgame positions,
especially by the time you get to the last 3
moves, your best move (or at least a sure
winning move) will be self-evident. Count-
ing is not absolutely necessary in these cas-
es. Similarly, some possible sequences are
so obviously foolish that we usually need
not consider (or count) them. Still, in close
games when the best move is not obvious, or
anytime when you need to be certain of the
final result, there is no substitute for an accu-
rate count.
Sometimes, even an approximate count
can indicate the correct choice of moves. For

example, in Diagram 65, Black's two choic-
es seen approximately equal at first glance.
In both cases, Black flips just one disc (b2)
and White's final move flips 5 edge discs.
Therefore, determining the better move will
depend entirely on the number of interior
discs White flips. If Black takes b1, then
White-a2 flips only 3 interior discs (b2, b3,
and c2). If Black instead takes a2, White-b1
flips more than 3 interior discs (6 discs to be
precise: b2, b3, c2, d3, e4, and f5). Thus,
even without an exact count, it becomes

Interior Sweeps. Another endgame tech-
nique, closely related to counting, often oc-

the game. It is now mostly a case of how to
maximize the final disc count. If there are

opportunities for ""interior sweeps."" While

"nique are beyond the scope of this Hand-
book, we will show three (hopefully instruc-
tive) examples of the basic principle. In
Diagram 66, with correct play, Black can
systematically sweep White off the board
and achieve a 64-0 victory. Black's goals are
twofold: develop solid ""masses"" of stable
discs while continuing to minimize White's
options. Black's initial move should be to d2;
White is then forced to respond with b1, and
play continues with: a1, pass; c2, c3; b3, b2;
a2, a3; c4, b4; a4, pass; c5, b5; a5, pass; b6,
pass; b7, a6; a7, pass; a8. Play out this se-
quence yourself, and note especially how the
exact sequence of the first few moves is criti-
cal to accomplish the necessary move limita-
tion. For example, playing a8, instead of d2,
for the first move will result in later moves
flipping unwanted discs, opening up new
choices for White and preventing the ""wipe-
out.""
Not all interior sweeps lead to ""wipe-out""
victories. In some cases, an effective interior
sweep can even be accomplished by sacrific-
ing a corner (and perhaps an adjacent edge
as well). In fact, in these next two examples,
Black sacrifices a corner in preference to
taking it! These sequences reveal a elegance
in strategy that contrasts to the often effec-
tive but ""brute force"" approach of taking the
comer. Thus, in Diagram 67, note how
Black's moves 39 and 41 cleared White al-

71, even though the remaining region is an
odd-numbered one. Here it would be a mis-
take to take h8 initially, since Black is left
with no moves, forcing White to go again
and giving Black the crucial last move. Far
better is to go to h7 initially, feeding Black

with h8 and wins!
Probably the best overall advice for end-
game play is ""expect the unexpected."" Even
experts are frequently frustrated as they
watch ""sure winning positions"" disappear
due to some unforeseen lack of access or
similar problem. Players need to be on guard
for the hidden dangers and/or opportunities
that may exist in a given position. For now, I

means comprehensive) of what may await
an unsuspecting Othello player. See if you

Context: moves in each case before reading further.
The first two Diagrams both involve unu-
sual aspects of the main diagonal (see also
Point #8). In Diagram 72, al would be a
mistake since it allows White to continue
with bl, thereby gaining undeniable access
to the h8 comer. The best move is b1(‘), ex-
tending Black's control of the main diago-
nal. White's position now crumbles as he is
forced to choose between g1 or h7. In Dia-
gram 73, White's control of the al-h8 main
diagonal unexpectedly winds up costing
him the game. White wants to get 2 of the 3
remaining moves in the al corner region and
so begins by going to b1. Black continues
with al, but since Black has no discs on the
main diagonal, b2 does not get flipped. This
prevents White from gaining access to a2,
forcing White to go to g8. Black now gets
both a2 and h8 and wins the game. (Note:
even if White had begun with g8, he still
would have lost.)
Sometimes, the best move is so counter-
intuitive, or so seems to violate established
principles, that it is very difficult to find it.
Thus, m Diagram 74, Black wants to get 2 of
the three moves in the a8 comer region and
would even being willing to give up the a8
corner to do so. The move to b8 fails, since
after White takes a8, Black does not have ac-
cess to b7. Similarly, the move to b7 fails,
since White can now balance the South edge
by taking b8 without giving Black access to
a8. Black's best move turns out to be the
seemingly suicidal move to b2, conceding

"a8. Black's best move turns out to be the
seemingly suicidal move to b2, conceding
White the North and West edges. But after
Othello: Brief & Basic
White continues with the semi-forced move
to al, Black can now go to b7 without allow-
ing White to balance the South edge. The 1
perfect play final sequence 1s g2-h1-b8-a8-
pass-h8-pass-g7 resulting in a 40-24 win for
Black! (Note the general idea of how a move
in one area of the board — the al area — had
a critical effect on another, seemingly unre-
lated area of the board - the a8 area.)
In the most extreme cases, conceptual
analysis appears to be essentially useless,
while only a computer would seem to be
able find the correct path by counting. Thus, oe
in Diagram 75, Black made the reasonable
move to a8. Unfortunately, it is also a losing i?
move (assuming subsequent perfect play).
The winning move was h7(!), even though Diagram 75: Black to mowe
this sacrifices the al comer, as well as the
West and North edges. In trying to make
some sense of this difficult position, note
that a disadvantage of a Black move to a8is_
that White can then get the last move in that
region by taking the likely stable wedge at
b8. [Note: With perfect play, Black wins 36-
27 after h7 (h7-al-b2-f8-h2-b8-a8-c1-g8;
neither player gets h1!) but loses 31-33 after
a8 (a8-b8-h7-g8-f8-c 1-h1-h2-b2-a1).]

along with some counting (if possible) will
often uncover the best attack. Thus in Dia- ®

move, going into the odd-numbered remain-
ing region in preference to the even- [Jj agram To: W
numbered h8 region. However, it turns out
the a8 is a losing move. The only winning
move is g8(!) leading to a 33-31 win for White after the following perfect play se-
quence: h7-a8-b8-a7. The major problem is that if White takes a8 initially, Black goes
to b8. Now White cannot safely continue with a7 or the entire 7th row will become
White, giving Black both h7 and g8 and the game. So White must continue with g8 in-
stead, Black follows with h7, with White finally going to a7. But, despite the similarity
of this sequence to the winning one, it results in a 33-31 loss for White. An attempt to
count out the net gain after each of these two most likely sequences would reveal the ad-
vantage of g8 over a8.

Context: players are inevitably presented with the decision as to whether or not to occupy an
edge square. This raises one of the more complex issues in all of Othello. These next
two sections present some useful general guidelines for dealing with this issue.
As discussed earlier (see Points #1 - #5), players unaware of move limitation strate-
gy often feel its best to take edge squares as soon and as often as possible. While it's true
that ultimate possession of at least some edge squares is usually necessary to win, this
""rush to the edge"" concept has been clearly discredited. In fact, some expert players
Othello: Brief & Basic 35
Oo —- om th f& WwW hi

believe it is best to avoid taking edge squares for as long as it is feasible. By this view,
edge square moves tend to become liabilities later in the game (by poisoning otherwise
good moves etc.). Personally, I would advise against either extreme. Indeed, edge
square moves do have at least one distinct advantage: there are less ways to flip an edge
piece than a interior piece. Thus, the proper and judicious use of edge moves may help
promote move limitation. Also, once your opponent has gone to an edge, a move to that
edge often becomes much more desirable for you. Finally, recall that we have previous-
ly discussed a special tempo-gaining edge technique: ""creeping along the edge"" (see
Points #5 & #16).
For simplicity, our discussions will usually focus only on one edge at a time, in rela-

"Read the following context and answer the question.
Context: For simplicity, our discussions will usually focus only on one edge at a time, in rela-
tive isolation from the rest of the board. But be aware that, in a real game, edge moves
must be evaluated using general principles and in the context of the entire board - the in-
terior area as well as the other three edges. For example, in Diagram 77, Black decides
to take the edge move to a4. The major rationale for this decision was not any special at-
tribute of the west edge, but the fact that, by flipping c4, it set up a Perfectly Quiet
Move (see Point #15) to e6. An edge move to a3 or a5, or almost any other non-edge
move would not have accomplished this. In other cases, edge move choices may be pri-
marily dictated by the number of non-edge discs flipped (e.g. Diagram 77 as well as Di-
agrams 7,8 & 9 in Point #3).
There are two major goals, beyond the
a booed oe f 9g oh general ones of move limitation strategy, to
bear in mind when deciding to go to an edge
(prior to comers being occupied): 1. Try to
be the last player able to take a safe move
along the edge (e.g. gain a tempo along the
edge). Similarly, try to get more of the
moves along an edge than your opponent.
2. Try to obtain a desirable final edge posi-
tion or force your opponent to take an unde-
sirable one (e.g. an unbalanced edge). These
two points will be the focus of much of the
subsequent discussion. Often these two con-
cepts, tempo vs. position, will be in conflict

aoboocid ¢ f g sh In this section, we will focus on some of the
edge-specific factors (as opposed to the
more general considerations) that help to de-
termine when to occupy an edge square. As
a general rule, it is a poor choice to initiate
an edge by going to a C-square (see Point
#6). But assuming a choice, how does a
player decide when an edge move is advisa-
ble, and which edge square move (among
the available A and B squares) is the best?
Here, the decision must involve looking at
least a little beyond the edge. For example,
in Diagram 78, White considers a move to
the cl A-square. This is probably a poor
choice since it flips both c2 and d2, totally
Diagram 76 shutting White off from any subsequent
moves to the North edge. Contrast this with

row is all Black). White still retains access to h7 (which could be critical in avoiding an

What is probably a poor choice?",moving to the cl A-square
"was important to move to the North edge, d1 (a B-square) would probably be preferable
to cl (since d1 flips only the d2 non-edge disc). Which 1s the best choice? Sorry, but
there's no clear answer here (especially given this limited analysis). In fact, it isn't even
clear that an edge move 1s called for here: many experts might choose b5 as the best
move. This is because, since Black does not have access to b6, White's move to b5 does
not open up any obviously good moves for Black. The pressure is now on Black. It's be-
cause even experts disagree about the best move in positions like this that each Othello
game tums out differently.
Another example (Diagram 79) presents a less ambiguous set of choices. It is White
to play. Note the relative advantages of a move to a6 vs. h6. The a6 move allows an
easy a4 response for Black. White has gained nothing: neither a tempo nor a positional
advantage. In contrast, the h6 move looks much better: Black cannot respond with hé4. If
Black responds with h5, White continues with h4 (gaining a tempo at very little cost po-
sitionally). In either case, Black is now forced to move to the North edge, leading to a
weakening of his position.
[A slight digression: One guide in choos-
ing from among alternative edge moves (as

"agram 77 for the moment, we note a previ-
ously unmentioned advantage of Black's
move to a4: it maintains a tempo advantage
along the West edge for Black. That is,
White's only possible West edge responses
to a4 are to the adjacent squares of a3 or a5
(in this case, White doesn't even have access
to a5). In either case, Black could flip the
White disc on his next turn (e.g. White - a3;
Black - a2), leaving White with no more
moves along the edge. However, Black's a4
move also has its problems: by flipping three
interior discs (b4, c4 and d4) it reduces Diagram 79: White to play
Black's future mobility and may open up
new good moves for White. Also, if White
continues with 16. a3, Black has to choose between giving up the tempo or taking a
weak C-square move (a2) early in the game.
Black's move to a4 at move 15 is referred to as taking the edge ""head-on."" Contrast
this to the situation if Black had gone to a5 instead (taking the edge ""diagonally"" or
""slanted""). Now White can respond with a3 and Black will no longer gain a tempo. Ac-
tually, White might choose a4 in preference to a3. While this allows Black the tempo-
gaining continuation to a3, Black is unlikely to be in a hurry to take a3. The move has
the undesirable effect of flipping the discs at b4 and c5 as well as leading Black towards
a possible over-abundance of edge discs that may poison moves and be a mobility-
reducing liability later in the game. But if Black does not take a3, White can continue
with a6!
Question: How does the author feel about Black's move to a4?

The answer to the above question is",not enough information
"reducing liability later in the game. But if Black does not take a3, White can continue
with a6!
White's a3 (tempo) response to 15. a5 is sometimes referred to as the ""American""
style of edge play while the a4 (positional) response is labelled the ""European"" style.
One cannot assume that either style is always to be preferred. Similarly, taking the edge
head-on (15. a4) seems preferable to the a5 choice for Black in this position (Diagram
77), though there are other positions when taking the edge diagonally would be pre-
ferred. ]

So, what is more critical: gaining a tempo or avoiding a weak edge position? Taking
an edge or an interior square? Taking an edge head-on or slanted? Taking too many
edge squares or too little? Taking an edge square adjacent to an opponent's disc or away
from the opponent? We have seen that the answer to these questions is an unsatisfactory
one: It depends. This section detailed the issues relevant to making these decisions. Af-
ter this, experience will be the best teacher.
20. Edge play: Developing & Resolving Edges
Developing an Edge. Moves subsequent to the initial move to the edge are moves
that develop the edge. For most of this discussion, we will focus on what happens after
an initial White move to an A-square. Similar principles could be applied to an initial
move to a B-square. The discussion will also focus primarily on the decisions of the

Context: move to a B-square. The discussion will also focus primarily on the decisions of the
player who initiated the edge (White in this case). At this point, Black will have three
basic choices (assuming access to the relevant squares): avoid the edge altogether, go to
a square adjacent to White's disc, or go to square non-adjacent to White's disc. By dis-
cussing the merits of White's responses to each of these type of moves, we will also de-
velop a feeling for the merits of Black's ini-
tial choice.

quent move limitation problems and/or
weak edge positions. Diagram 80 illustrates
some (by no means all) edge positions sub-
sequent to White's decision to develop edges
C that Black has avoided. Along the East edge
is a table pattern (White is in possession of
both A-squares and there are no other pieces

has the advantage of being a secure edge:

"maining vacant B-square). However, this table is also disadvantageous in that it is a
closed edge to White: White has no access to any of the remaining vacant squares along
the edge (unless Black moves there first). In contrast, the table along the South edge 1s
not closed to White: since c7 and d7 are Black, White maintains considerable safe ac-
cess to the edge (i.e. it remains an open edge for White). The vacant square at f7 should
also be considered among the possible moves in this region: White can probably gain a
tempo by going there, but will lose all access to the h8 corner region by doing so. Final-
ly, note that White's North edge position has created a type of weakness referred to as a
hole (d1). White has no access to this square but Black can wedge in there with a free
move at any time he wishes. Though experts sometimes find it useful to create these
holes (typically to gain a necessary tempo), they should be avoided as a general rule.
The next three diagrams show some selected positions after Black has gone to an
edge initialized by White. In these diagrams, the edge decisions are simplified by the
fact that the 4 squares immediately interior to the A and B edge squares are all occu-
pied. Obviously, im actual games, this will not always be the case. In Diagram 81, there
are two edges where Black followed White's A-square moves by going to the adjacent
B-square. Along the North edge, White should probably not move to the edge at all.

needn't worry about Black's potential move
to bl: it forms a dangerously weak ""uneven
three"" that White could exploit in various
ways later in the game (possibly setting up a
Stoner trap or making a semi-forcing move
to el, etc.). Along the East edge, rather than
leaving the edge alone, a move to h4 for
White seems attractive: since it doesn't flip
g4, White still retains access to h3. This
pressures Black to prevent the h3 move by
going to either h3 or h2. Once again, the de-
sirability of a type of move varies with the
overall board position!
Diagram 82 shows three situations after
Black has followed White's mitial A-square Diagram 1
moves by going to the non-adjacent B-
square. Itis typically a poor move for White
to continue by going to the remaining A-
square (e.g. f1 along the North edge), as this a_i
allows Black to wedge in at dl and safely,
gain the last move along the edge. An initial
White move to d1 would be better: it doesn't
flip e2 and thus leaves Black's mobility re-
stricted along the edge. On the East edge, an
h6 move shares similar problems with f1,
but h4 works out less well than does d1.

"Read the following context and answer the question.
Context: Along the South edge, there is a surprise: If
White goes to f8, Black will not have access
to the d8 square: Black will be forced to
choose between going to g8 (taking a rela-
tively weak C-square edge position) or let-
tng White take d8 on White's next tum
(thereby allowing White to gain a tempo,
though White will be closing off the edge if
he does)! It is usually a difficult no-win type
of decision for Black. White's move to f8
followed by Black's ""unexpected"" lack of
edge square access (to d8 in this case) is re-
ferred as an ""edge trap"". It is one of several
possible types of edge traps (two more ex-
amples are discussed in Diagram 84). These
traps can often have a critical influence on
the outcome of the game (e.g. see Pomt
#21).
Black's remaining major option, after
White's initial A-square move, is to go to the
opposite A-square. White then has to decide
whether to continue to develop the edge. In
Diagram 83, we see three of the more com-
mon edge patterns that can develop (they
may also develop from other initial posi-
tions). The North and East edges both show
a 3-disc edge pattern called a Boscov. Diagram 83

Question: What is probably true about the game of Othello?
Answer:",It is a very popular game.
"B-square (i.e. d1 or h4), challenging the opponent to take a C-square along that edge
(or lose a tempo). Note how, in this case, a Black move to d1 works out better than the
comparable move to h4. This is because if White continues to g1 along the North edge,
White is left with an unbalanced edge (White has no access to b1), while an h2 continu-
ation along the East could be followed by White balancing the edge at h7 (see Point #7
for more on unbalanced edges). An initial move to h4 also works out less well than d1
for White: 1t would flip the disc at g3 to White, permitting Black to follow with h7,
threatening to balance the edge by going to h2 on his next turn (but see the discussion of
Diagram 86). Given all this, | would probably recommend the player whose turn it is in
Diagram 83 to take d1 (before his opponent does)!
[Another slight digression: A variation on the basic Boscov pattern would be if the
Black disc at h5, in Diagram 83, was at h4 instead. A full discussion of the advantages
vs. disadvantages of these two variations is beyond the scope of this Handbook, though
they usually focus on issues such as which variation offers the better chance of getting
(or preventing the opponent from getting) a balanced edge (e.g. in the position shown in
the Diagram, a White move to h4 would flip g3 and f2, while in the variation position, a
White move to h5 results in a nearly identical East edge pattern but does not flip the g3

leaves Black in a losing position. So instead, Black should go to b2 immediately, pre-
venting White from safely balancing the North edge. Now it is Black that will win the
game. [A digression: Moves like Black's b2 move can sometimes block opponent's
from A-squares as well as C-squares, as would be the case if cl were vacant in Diagram

combining these ideas into an integrated overview. For example, in a given position,
there may be an unbalanced edge waiting to be balanced, an opponent's move waiting to
be poisoned, a potential tempo-gain by the opponent to try to prevent, and a safe move
to take before the opponent blocks it. Which of these valid concerns should take prece-

Decisive Moves. It often happens, espe-
cially between two players of about equal
skill, that the endgame arrives with neither
player having a clear path to victory. It may
be that a computer could show that one or
the other player has an undeniable win with
perfect play, but since neither player is like-
ly to play perfectly for the last 20 moves,
this may not be very relevant (though it of-
ten provides a very instructive after-the-
game analysis). Yet, at some point, a move

Question: The author probably believes that:
Answer:",Othello is a game that requires a lot of thought
"is made after which, barring any major blun-
ders, the outcome seems decided. This move
is called the decisive move (though occa-
sionally the critical nature of such a move
will not be apparent until looked at in retro-
spect one or two moves later). I realize this
is a subjective definition, since recognition
of a decisive move will depend upon a
player's overall Othello ability. But I still be-
lieve itis an instructive concept.
An example of this concept is in Dia-
gram 87. White has an opportunity to make
a decisive move. Before reading further, see
if you can find it. Ready? Okay. White
should go to al! Though this is a fairly obvi-
ous choice to Othello experts, less skilled
players (who have learned about the danger
of unbalanced edges) may be surprised. Af-
ter all, this move allows Black to follow by
taking the wedge at bl, gaining undeniable
access to h1 securing both the north and east
edges. Despite all this, after al-b1l-a7-h1-g2,
White gets the remaining 2 corners and
more than enough discs to win the game. In
contrast, if White takes the seemingly desir-
able quiet move to a7 (rather than a1 initial-
ly), it quickly leads to disaster. Black fol-
lows with g7, gaining control of the al-h8
main diagonal. Now White can no longer go
to al. He has missed his chance at a decisive
move, and is now set up to lose all four cor-
ners and the game. In essence, Black's g7
(rather than White's potential al) became
the decisive move of the game. [Note: A

similar situation existed in Diagram 86:
Black needed to recognize and take the deci-
sive move to b2 rather than the seemingly
safer (but losing) move to h7.] Note also
how a seemingly minor change in just one
disc can alter the position dramatically:
thus, if the disc at d4 in Diagram 87 were
White, a Black move to g7 would no longer
give Black control of the main diagonal.
White could now safely go to a7 (in prefer-
ence to the previously recommended a1)!
Othello: Brief & Basic
The point of all this is: Always be watching for decisive moves and when you find
one, take it immediately. Don't let the critical moment pass. Make sacrifices if neces-
sary. Look especially for bold unexpected moves that may seal a victory rather than
more conservative ""safe"" moves that leave the outcome still in doubt. Avoid the tempta-
tion to wait for a more favorable position or you may discover that your winning oppor-
tunity will disappear altogether.
My personal favorite for a decisive move is from a ""postal Othello"" game I played.
The critical position is shown in Diagram 88—A. I was Black and none of my possible
choices at move 41 seemed to lead to the clear-cut path to victory that I was seeking. Fi-
nally, I discovered a truly wonderful (and decisive) move: a5! Even though it sacrificed
the al corner, I knew I had the game won. After White predictably went to a1, I contin-

ued by going to a7, allowing White to take a second comer at a8(!). I then went to b2 at
move 45, leaving the position as shown in Diagram 88-B. The game was now ""over"":
White would be forced to concede the h1 corner and I had b1, b7, and b8 as free moves
whenever I wanted them!
Though ""provable"" decisive moves are a ob
limited to the endgame, moves that appear to
be decisive (1.e. that seem to be a pivotal
turning point in the game) can occur much
earlier, even in the opening phase. For exam-
ple, Diagram 89 is taken from a game I
played in the 1982 U.S. Nationals. I went to
cl at move 18 which set up an edge trap of
the sort described in Diagram 82 (i.e. Black
has no access to e1). In this case, Black has
even worse problems: if he chooses to go to
b1 (to avoid the loss of tempo), White could
continue with g2, setting up a Stoner trap
(see Point #8). Black therefore went to h3,
leaving White to take el at move 20. This
was the beginning of a deterioration that led
to Black decisively losing the game.

Prioritizing of Moves. Decisive moves are really a special case of a still more gen-
eral concept: how to ""read the position"" and prioritize the possible moves. That is,
how to determine what aspect of any position is most critical -- what opportunity needs
Question: What is the name of the game?
Answer:",not enough information
"Read the following article and answer the question.
Article: how to determine what aspect of any position is most critical -- what opportunity needs
to be taken immediately or what pitfall needs to be avoided at all costs. This, in turn, de-
termines which move to take. For example, it may be that if you do not immediately
block your opponent's good move, your opponent will gain a clear advantage (or, in the
worst case, a decisive winning position). Clearly, you must prevent this if you can.
Thus, White's decision in Diagram 87 to make the al move, as opposed to a7 (or any
other move), can be viewed as based on the recognition that preventing Black from
gaining control of the al-h8 main diagonal was the most critical, highest priority con-
cern at that moment. All other considerations were secondary. It wouldn't matter wheth-
er White knew that al was a winning move or not. It would be sufficient for White to
know that unless he stopped Black from getting control of the main diagonal, it would
lead to a sure loss.
Diagram 90 presents another example on this topic. It is Black to move. The ques-
tion is: What is the highest priority issue for Black in this position and what move will
best address this issue? First let's take an overview look at the board: Black has numer-
ous choices but few good ones. Black is walled off from the south edge, while White is
walled off from the north and east edges except for the black disc at c2. But Black is un-

The priorities are now clear: it is imperative
that Black establish access to b6 immediate-
ly, in as quiet a manner as possible. The best
choice is d1! By flipping the disc at d4, it es-
tablishes undeniable access to b6. As a bo-
nus, it opens up no new moves for White -
White already has access to cl. No other
Black move has all these benefits. It still
may not be certain that Black will win the
game after the dl move, but he has clearly
recognized the highest priority issue and
made the move that best deals with it. A
player that consistently make moves like this is sure to be a tough opponent.

and experience to come up with what you hope will be the best choice. The ability to
read positions quickly and accurately is certainly one of the hallmarks of what separates

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER: THE COMPLETE GAME
In this section, we finally put together all the pieces from the previous 21 points and, for
the first time, examine transcripts of complete games between expert players. But first,
let's review some advice particularly relevant to game transcript analyses:
1. Look for the pivotal pomts im the game (e.g. What opening was chosen and how did it
develop? Who seems to have the lead and who is playing defensively in each phase of the
game? When did the decisive move occur?) Note that the timing or sequencing of moves is
often critical: a move that wins the game if taken immediately, may be a game-losing blun-
der by the player's next turn. Similarly, the placement or flipping of even a single disc can
be critical to the outcome of a game.
Question: Which of the following is not mentioned in the passage?
Answer:",The players' attitudes towards the game.
"Read the following article and answer the question.
Article: be critical to the outcome of a game.
2. Try to read the position as the players might have: what was each player's highest pri-
ority concern at each move and why? How did the players resolve decisions involving
multiple considerations and/or apparently equally attractive moves (e.g. trying to decide
which of two quiet moves to take first)?
3. In many of the previous diagrams, the positions were chosen (or even contrived) to
show a particular point as clearly as possible. In a real game, issues are often not that clear.
Real players (even experts) don't always resolve these issues correctly, so don't assume
that these transcripts are free of player errors. Try to discover any critical mistakes.
4. Study the transcripts for examples of how the strategies and tactics discussed in this
Handbook are actually used (e.g. how was control obtained and maintained? How, if at all,
did the player avoid the ""tightening noose"" of move limitation? Was there an attempt at
""edge-creeping"" and was it successful? Did there appear to be any unusual preplanned
openings, good counter-intuitive moves, or unexpected traps etc.?). In summary, try to de-
velop a feel for the ""flow"" of a game - see each move in the context of an overall plan rath-
er than as an isolated decision.

and giving Rose complete control of the game).
These mini-analyses only touch the surface of what could be said about these games.
Playing the game out yourself will hopefully provide still more insights.

If someone were to ask me what I consider to be the single most important lesson a nov-
ice player could learn from reading this Handbook, it would be this: A realization, contrary
to some popular opinions, that Othello is not a game of luck nor a game in which planning
ahead is a futile exercise. It is instead a game with well-defined strategical and tactical con-
cepts (ones that are often different from what the novice player initially supposes), and in

Article: cepts (ones that are often different from what the novice player initially supposes), and in
which long-term planning is all but essential. Itis my hope that this realization serves to in-
crease your enjoyment and understanding of this fascinating game. I hope it stimulates
your interest to learn still more about the game. To the extent that this Handbook has ac-
complished these goals, it has been successful.

In addition, I would hope that the reader gains some insight into the elegant ""simplicity""
of Othello. This can be best understood by considering how the better computer Othello
programs decide on their best move (prior to their endgame counting). Their programmers
have not provided them with even a small fraction of all the information presented in this
Handbook. Generally, they rely mostly on just a few of the more fundamental ideas: e.g.
move limitation and mobility, evaporation, value of stable discs. From these few and sim-
ple algorithms, the computer has to ""self-generate"" the ability to successfully deal with un-
balanced edges, gain control of the main diagonal, spring edge-traps etc. It seems remarka-
ble to me how well some computers can play, given these limitations. It serves as a useful
lesson to humans trying to develop a broad overview of what is important in learning to
play Othello well: the critical ideas are relatively few but extensive in their implications!

And of course, I would hope that this Handbook would enable you to become a better
player, help you to start on the road to joining the ranks of the experts. At the very least, I
hope this book would enable you to observe a game between experts with a much greater
sophistication and a much diminished sense of mystery. There's certainly a wealth of infor-
mation 1n here to assist the aspiring Othello player. But be aware that there is also much to
master that was never even mentioned: more techniques for maintaining mobility that go
beyond evaporation, more on timing of moves and setting up long sequences of moves,
more unusual edge plays and endgame ploys, more on creative and counter-intuitive
moves, much more on preplanned openings, deeper analyses of complete games, how to
play well under tournament time pressure, and more on aspects of Othello that I haven't
even discovered yet. And still more. In fact, the single biggest problem I had in writing
this Handbook was deciding what to leave out. There was always one more point I wanted
to make or one more diagram I wanted to include.
Finally, one of the things that any experts reading this Handbook would know is: every-
thing I've written here is wrong! — at least some of the time. Or to put it in its more usual

APPENDIX: SELECTED GAME TRANSCRIPTS
This appendix includes a selection of transcripts of games from major tournaments
played during 1984-1986. Their purpose here is to give the reader the opportunity for fur-
ther study of ""real game"" situations involving current experts. I hope the reader does not
object that four of the transcripts are of games in which I was one of the players. I include
them because they are among the more memorable of the games I have played, even (per-
haps especially) those that I did not win.
The brief comments are no substitute for detailed game analyses, but they do highlight
some critical points in each game. Note particularly how often unforced X-square moves
and corner sacrifices figure prominently in determining the outcomes. Finally, answers to
the questions posed in the discussions below can be found at the end of this appendix.
Game 1. T. Landau (B)-35 vs. D. Shaman
(W)-29. In 1984, I won the U.S. National
Championship with a 5-1 record in the final
rounds. This game against David Shaman was
one of the highlights of the day for me. Note
particularly move 43. b5. Though b4 seemed

vanced to the semi-finals of the 1984 World,
Championship. This game was the first of a
best two-out-of-three match against Japanese
Champion, Ryoichi Taniguchi. After narrowly
avoiding being run out of moves in the late
midgame, I reached the position prior to move
44. I had a elegant opportunity for a decisive
winning move here. I came close to finding it -

decisive move 37. a3. White is on the ropes
now: whether he goes to a2 or a5, Black fol-
lows with 39. b6. If White takes b6 at 38,
Black follows with a5. In any case, White is
shortly run out of safe moves. Unfortunately
for me, I lost the deciding third game and
Taniguchi went on to meet Paul Ralle of
France in the finals.
Game 4. R. Taniguchi (B)-15 vs. P. Ralle

Championship Goiming the U.S.'s Jonathan
Cerf as the only non-Japanese players to do
so) with this dramatic game. The critical posi-
tion is at move 34. Ralle chose the X-square at
b7 and when Taniguchi continued with 35. f1,
Ralle countered with 36. g2! The endgame
was still several moves away, yet Ralle had al-
ready taken two X-squares and two unbal-
anced edges. Despite all this, Taniguchi was
helpless -- Ralle had a clear unassailable win.
Game 5. D. Shaman (B)-34 vs. I. Leader
(W)-30. David Shaman and Imre Leader both
finished with 4-2 records at the 1985 U.S. Na-
tional Championship finals. This necessitated
a play-off game to determine the champion. It
was one of the best games of the tournament.
Question: Taniguchi and Shaman are both   _  .
Answer:",Japanese
"Read the following article and answer the question.
Article: a play-off game to determine the champion. It
was one of the best games of the tournament.
Note particularly the sequence of moves from
25-27 where Shaman took some questionable
edge positions in exchange for a gain in tem-
po. The trade worked and Shaman went on to
win. It's also worth mentioning that, despite
some unusual appearing moves in the end-
game, Shaman had a_ winning position
throughout the sequence that he never relin-
quished.
Game 6. T. Landau (B)-26 vs. D. Shaman
(W)-38. This game comes from the 1986 U.S.
National Championship. Starting with an un-
common move 5, I eventually established a
midgame advantage by exploiting Shaman's
weak north edge. Some comments: 23. b3
would have probably been preferable to the ac-
tual 23. h2. Next, note how effectively 33. a3

Game 2, I let my hard won advantage evapo-
rate in the endgame. The critical position is at
move 45. See if you can come up with the de-
cisive winning move that I missed.
Game 7. D. Shaman (B)-28 vs. B. Rose
(W)-36. This was the second of three games
that Brian Rose and David Shaman played
against each other in the 1986 U.S. Nationals
finals. Here, Shaman declines the opportunity

Article: finals. Here, Shaman declines the opportunity
to take an unbalanced edge by refusing to go to
a2 at move 17. Rose responds by grabbing the
unbalanced edge himself (with a7 at move 18).
Despite sacrificing nearly two entire edges,
Rose gains control of the game by move 40
and goes on to win.
Game 8. D. Shaman (B)-36 vs. B. Rose
(W)-28. Shaman and Rose were tied at 5-1 at
the end of the 1986 U.S. Nationals, necessitat-
ing this play-off game (the second for Shaman
in as many years). Moves 1-16 were identical
to their previous game (see Game 7 above).
This time Shaman took the unbalanced edge at
move 17 (moving to a2). Note how this deci-
sion led to a distinctly different game, despite
the identical opening. Rose's move 34 was
likely a mistake since it allowed the effective
35. g2 (34. b7 would have been better). The
cliff-hanging endgame, though exciting, was
not perfectly played. Shaman's move 47. c8&
was a game-losing mistake -- b8 was the win-
ning move! However, Rose's game-losing
move 52. a7 returned the game to Shaman. See
if you can spot the move Rose should have
made instead.
Game 9. M. Takizawa (B)-35 vs. H. Tam-
enori (W)-29. These final 3 transcripts repre-
sent state-of-the-art Othello as played by the
world's best: the Japanese. If the rationale be-
hind some of the moves seems elusive, don't

the 1986 Japanese National Championship -
Tamenori defeating Yuji Katayama. Note par-
ticularly moves 45-47: Black sacrifices the al
corner with 45. b2, but White cannot afford to
take it (or Black will have free moves at a2
and bl). So White hands the corner back to
Black with 46. a2! Black declines the al cor-
ner for the moment, taking the hl corner in-
stead -- exchanging the unbalanced east edge
for a gain in tempo. In case you're wondering,

White goes anyplace else at move 46, White takes the al corner at move 47. Despite the
ill-considered move 45 to h7, Black still had a chance for victory at move 47. The oppor-
tunity to go to f1 was gone, yet the unlikely move of 47. g7 leads to a 36-28 win (assum-
ing subsequent perfect play: g7-A7-b2-H8-g8-A1-a2-H1-a8-B8-f1-G1-b7-PASS-g2).
Black chose g2 instead and went on to lose.
Game 8. White should have gone to b8 rather than a7. The perfect play sequence is as
follows: B8-g1-PASS-b7-A8-b1-C1-b2-A1-a7 (White wins 34-30).

OTHER BOOKS ON OTHELLO
Books on Othello, are a relative rarity (especially if you want one written in English).
Here is a listing of those of which I am aware (together with some brief commentary):
Ball, J.A. & Parker, J.R., The Key to Othello, 1981 (English)
A small pamphlet (akin to Brief & Basic) that comes from England. Most ideas are in
the right direction, but not enough solid information. Overstates the importance of cer-
tain principles of play.
Hasegawa, Goro, How to Win at Othello, 1977 (English translation of Japanese by
Maxine Brady)
The worst possible book. Avoid it at all costs. It can do serious harm to your Othello
ability. Ironically, it was written by the Japanese ""inventor"" of Othello (who apparent-
ly understood little of what his game is about). Unfortunately, this is the only book on
Othello to ever get wide distribution in the United States. Thankfully, it is no longer in
print. The only lingering contribution of this text is the terminology for A,B,C, and X
squares.

Inoue, H., A Discovery of Reversals, 1977 (Japanese)
Though written in Japanese, it is an excellent text just for the diagrams, especially on
openings and endgame positions. The author is one of Japan's first crop of great Othel-
lo players and a former World Champion.
Japan Othello Game Association, How to Othello, 1983 (Japanese)
A more up-to-date treatment of Othello from the Japanese. Again useful for the dia-
grams. Overall, does not seem as elegant a text as Inoue's classic.
Pingaud, Francois, Othello/Reversi, 1983 (French)
A good introductory text. The author was aware of OQ and even borrowed some ideas
and terminology from it. If you understand French even minimally, you would prob-
ably get some benefit from this text.
I am also aware of a Japanese text (published in 1986) on computer Othello (exact title
untranslated). And speaking of...
COMPUTER OTHELLO
If you are seeking a computer opponent to play against, be aware that most of the
Othello programs out there play a terrible game and use little or none of the principles
discussed in Brief & Basic. The better programs available are a frequent topic of discus-
sion in OQ, and I refer you there for the latest information. Systems are also available for
generating perfect-play endgame sequences. Clarence Hewlett (the current Editor of OQ)
