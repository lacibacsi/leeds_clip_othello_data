{"input":"builds up step by step from the basics of strategy to the advanced concepts used by\nexperts. Whether you are looking for some help to win against your family or friends,\nor you hope to become the next World Champion, this book will help you win at\nOthello.\nPart I (Chapters 1-7) of the book is written primarily with beginning and inter-\nmediate players in mind. It is meant to be read from beginning to end, with each\nchapter building on the previous ones. Part II (Chapters 8-16) covers more advanced\nmaterial; these chapters can be read in any order. Exercises appear at the end of most\nchapters. Some of these exercises will be difficult for novice players, but my hope is\nthat the answers will provide you with further insights into good strategy. The Ap-\npendix shows where to find resources related to Othello on the Internet.\nChapter 1 reviews the rules of Othello and introduces the notation used in this\nbook. While I expect that most readers will be familiar with the rules, I would encour-\nage you to at least quickly read through this chapter, which explains the notation used\nthroughout the book.\nChapter 2 discusses the most basic strategies in Othello, namely taking corners\nand making stable discs. Knowing these strategies is critical to understanding the\nstrategies which follow in rest of the book.\nChapter 3 covers the basic strategy which can force your opponent to give you\ncorners and stable discs.

Two critical concepts, pairs and tempos, are introduced.\nChapter 6 covers basic endgame strategy. Even for experts, the endgame is the\nhardest part of the game, and this chapter emphasizes winning in the easiest manner\npossible. The more difficult material on endgames appear in Chapters 8 and 13.\nChapter 7 discusses defensive plays, designed to prevent your opponent from\nmaking the sort of good moves that you are aiming for yourself.\nChapter 8 explores even number theory, also known as parity, which can make\nit much easier to find the right moves in the endgame. Using even number theory\ncorrectly is not easy, but it is important for anyone aspiring to become an expert.\nviii\nIntroduction\nChapters 9 and 10 cover \u201ctesuji\u201d, good moves that arise in certain positions\nwhich occur frequently enough to merit special attention.

The usual way to determine the score is to\nsimply count the number of discs of each color, e.g., if there are 34 black discs and 30\nwhite discs, then Black wins 34-30. If both players have the same number of discs,\nthen the game is a draw.\nIn tournament play, if one player captures all of his opponents discs, the game is\nusually scored as a 64-0 victory for that player, regardless of the number of discs on\nthe board. Further, in certain tournaments, such as the World Championship, empty\nsquares are awarded to the winner. For example, if at the end of the game there are 32\nblack discs and 29 white discs, with 3 empty squares, the score is recorded as a 35-29\nvictory for Black.\nRules and notation\n3\nExamples\nDiagrams 1-4 through 1-9 show a sequence of moves at the start of the game to\ndemonstrate the rules.

By the rules of\nplay, it is impossible to flip a disc in a corner, so that if you are able to take a corner,\nthat disc will be yours for the rest of the game. In Diagram 2-1, the disc on h8 must be\nwhite at the end of the game: even if Black later moves to both g8 and h7, he can not\ncapture the disc on h8. Moreover, once you have a corner, it is often possible to build\na large number of discs that are protected by the corner and can never be flipped.\nSuch discs are called stable discs.\na\n1\nb\n2\nc\n3\nd\n4\ne\n5\nf\n6\ng\n7\nh\n8\na\n1\nb\n2\nc\n3\nd\n4\ne\n5\nf\n6\ng\n7\nh\n8\na\n1\nb\n2\nc\n3\nd\n4\ne\n5\nf\n6\ng\n7\nh\n8\nIn Diagram 2-2, the discs on the bottom row are stable discs, and in Diagram 2-\n3, all 21 white discs are stable discs.

There is simply no way for Black to\nget \u201cbehind\u201d these discs to surround and flip them.

{"input":"want to give any to your opponent! Given the rules of the game, the only way for your\nopponent to take a corner is if you play in one of the squares next to a corner, i.e., the\nC-squares or X-squares.  The X-squares are particularly dangerous, and a move to an\nX-square early in the game is almost certain to give up the adjacent corner. For ex-\nample, in Diagram 2-4, White has just moved to the X-square at g7.  Although Black\ncan not take the h8 corner immediately, if he can establish even one disc on the c3-f6\ndiagonal, then Black will be able take the corner.\nDiagram 2-1\nDiagram 2-2\nDiagram 2-3\n6\nOthello: A Minute to Learn...A Lifetime to Master\nOne possibility is for Black to play b5, capturing the disc on e5, as shown in\nDiagram 2-5. No matter where White plays, he will not be able to recapture the e5\ndisc, and Black will be able to take the h8 corner on his next turn.  Once black has the\ncorner, all of his discs on row 8 become stable discs, and later in the game he is likely\nto be able to create stable discs on the right edge as well. In general, the earlier in the\ngame a corner is taken the more valuable it is, as the potential for building up stable\ndiscs around the corner is greater. In most cases, moving to an X-square early in the\ngame will prove to be a fatal error, although later in the book we will examine some\nexceptional circumstances under which early X-square moves are useful.\nWhile moves to the X-square will usually allow the opponent to take the adja-\nQuestion: Who is the author?\n===\nThe answer to the above question is","output":"not enough information"}

{"input":"cally discs on the edge squares could fit this definition, they are usually not included\nwhen speaking of frontier discs. A wall is a connected group of frontier discs of the\nsame color. For example, in Diagram 3-10, the black discs at b3, c3, d3, e3, f3, f4, g4,\nand g5 are all frontier discs and together they form a wall. Discs which are com-\npletely surrounded by other discs, such as e5 in Diagram 3-11, are called interior\ndiscs or internal discs. A move which creates many new frontier discs is called a\nloud move, while a quiet move creates relatively few frontier discs.\nThe real problem with White\u2019s move in Diagram 3-11 is not that it flips so many\npieces, but that it flips the wrong pieces. Of the nine discs flipped, seven (b3, c3, d3,\ne3, f3, g4, and g5) are frontier discs. This is an extreme example of a loud move,\nflipping Black\u2019s entire wall. In Diagram 3-10, White can choose between nine legal\nmoves (b2, c2, d2, e2, f2, g2, g3, h4 and h5), while in Diagram 3-12, White has only\ntwo options, c8 and g7.  By contrast, Black\u2019s options increase from seven in Diagram\n3-10 to seventeen in Diagram 3-11.\nRemember that you must flip at least one of your opponent\u2019s pieces in order to\nmove. Building a long wall leaves you with nothing to flip, cutting off your access to\nthe squares on the other side of the wall. Meanwhile, the same wall gives your oppo-\nnent a wide range of choices.

However,\nit does stand to reason that in situations where passing would be ideal, we should be\nlooking for moves which are as much like passing as possible.\nIn general, this means that quiet moves, which avoid creating a lot of frontier\ndiscs, are better than loud moves.

I\nwant to draw a clear distinction between the opening phase of the game, which is\nwhat I will discuss in this chapter, and book openings, i.e., moves that are prepared\nand memorized before the game begins (see chapter 11). There is really no standard\ndefinition of where the opening ends and the midgame begins. Often it is defined as\nthe first 10, 15, or at most 20 moves of the game. However, I prefer to think of the\nopening as being over as soon as any of the edge squares are taken.\nThe introduction of strong computer programs in the 1990\u2019s has had a dramatic\neffect on opening theory.

Chapter 3 stressed the benefits of quiet moves and the drawbacks of loud\nmoves, and we will normally look for quiet moves in the opening phase of the game\nas well. In this case, the definition for quiet moves I gave in Chapter 3 is not all that\nuseful, since all 5 of Black\u2019s choices flip exactly one disc, and both the disc played\nand the disc flipped will be frontier discs. Perhaps we could refine that definition and\nsay that the quietest move would be c5, since the piece flipped (d5) is surrounded in\nfive directions, and the c5 disc itself would be adjacent to three occupied squares.\nThe loudest move is c7, jutting out away from the other pieces.  Indeed, when I first\nstarted playing Othello in 1980, c5 was by far the most common choice for Black. It\njust seemed natural to cut the three white discs in the middle. Meanwhile, c7 was, and\nstill is, the least popular choice.

There are\nmany reasonably quiet moves, but none of them really\nestablishes a presence in the center.

{"input":"both sides play the edges. As I discussed in Chapter 4, in the opening there are often\nmany different moves to choose from, all of which result in a reasonably balanced\nposition. On the edges, the opposite is true. Usually there is one move that is clearly\nbetter than the rest, and a mistake can give your opponent a huge advantage.\nAs we have already seen, quiet moves are usually better than loud moves, and\nthis holds true for edge moves as well. If your opponent has run out of moves, then a\nquiet edge move is often enough to decide the game. We have already seen one ex-\nample of this in Diagram 3-3. In Diagram 5-1 Black has run out of safe moves, but it\nis White\u2019s turn. If White could pass, then Black would be forced to move to an X-\nsquare and concede a corner. Of course White can not pass, but he can play g1, which\nhas basically the same effect as a pass. As shown in Diagram 5-2, Black still has no\nsafe moves and must play to an X-square. Moves such as g1 in this example are\ncalled free moves: Black can not prevent White from taking g1 whenever he wants,\nand g1 offers no new safe options for Black. While it is possible to have a free move\nin the middle of the board, most free moves occur on the edge. Sometimes there will\nbe an opportunity for more than one free move along the same edge. In Diagram 5-3,\nWhite has three free moves along the eastern edge at h4, h3, and h2 (note that they\nmust be taken in that order), and can easily run Black out of moves.\nDiagram 5-1\nAccording to the above context, answer the following question.\nWhen does a free move occur?","output":"When the opponent has run out of moves"}

In all three cases, White will take the\neastern edge on his next turn and be left with a free move to h2.\nThe concept of tempo\nIn Diagrams 5-1 and 5-2, White uses a free move to achieve the same effect as a\npass. In Diagram 5-1 it is White\u2019s turn to move, but in Diagram 5-2, it is Black\u2019s turn.\nWhite has transferred the burden of initiating play to Black without offering Black\nany new safe options. In English, White is said to gain a tempo.

While the term wing refers only to this edge pattern, unbalanced can also be\nused to describe the top edge (unbalanced three) or the right edge (unbalanced four).\nUnbalanced edges are inherently dangerous as the occupied C-square could offer the\nopponent access to the adjacent corner.

The reason that edge moves tend to be so critical in determining the winner of\nthe game is that a mistake on the edge will often lose a tempo.

Diagram 6-2 shows one possible\nsequence of moves, resulting in the final position shown in Diagram 6-3. Notice that\nthroughout this sequence, White has very few choices, and Black just keeps on accu-\nmulating more and more stable discs. In general, once your opponent is out of safe\nmoves, you should try to keep him out of moves for the rest of the game. I have seen\nmany examples where people let their opponent back in the game by getting too\nfancy in the endgame, trying to squeeze out every last disc instead of winning in the\nsimplest way possible. With the board changing rapidly it is easy to overlook some-\nthing and make a silly mistake.

For example, in Diagram 6-5, if Black takes a8, then White plays away diago-\nnally at b5, and Black can not extend away from a8. The easiest way to win is shown\nin Diagram 6-6.

One common way to create this sort of situation is to use diagonal control,\ni.e., to capture all of the discs on one of the diagonal lines on the board. While this\nterm could be used to talk about any diagonal line, in the endgame it usually refers to\nthe long diagonals that run from a1 to h8 or a8 to h1, as shown in Diagram 6-16.\nUsually these are called the main diagonals, although in Japan they are often re-\nferred to as the whiteline and blackline (owing to the color of the discs in the starting\nposition), respectively.\nDiagonal control often allows you to move to an X-square, or sometimes both\nX-squares on the same diagonal, without offering your opponent a corner. These moves\nusually gain a tempo, and are often enough to run your opponent out of moves. Dia-\ngram 6-17 shows an example to illustrate the basic idea. White should play to g7,\ncontrolling the main diagonal, as shown in diagram 6-18.

In fact, if we are successful at running\nour opponent out of moves, forcing him to move to an X-square, we certainly hope to\nuse that X-square to take the adjacent corner. If the X-square move happens to control\nthe diagonal, then in order to take the corner, we must break the diagonal. That is,\nwe must establish a disc on the diagonal controlled by the opponent.

A swindle occurs when one player\ngets both moves in a pair because, following the first move into the pair, the opponent\ndoes not have a legal move to the other square in the pair. In Diagram 6-34, it might\nseem obvious that Black should play to h8, grabbing the entire right edge. White will\nend the game with g8 (Diagram 6-35), with White winning 33-31. However, notice\nwhat happens if Black plays to g8 instead (Diagram 6-36). In this case, White gets\nswindled; he does not have access to h8, and must pass! Black ends the game with h8,\nwinning 36-28 (Diagram 6-37).\nDiagram 6-38 shows another example of a swindle. Suppose that Black plays\na1, as in Diagram 6-39. White would like to wedge at b1, gaining access to h1. How-\never, in this case White can not play to b1 because he does not have a piece on the b\ncolumn. Black will later move to b1 himself, creating many stable discs. Also note\nhow this swindle gains valuable tempos for Black.

How-\never, there is another, equally important part of the game\u2014 preventing your opponent\nfrom making the same sort of good moves that you are aiming for yourself.  In this\nchapter we discuss defensive plays which attempt to take away good moves from the\nopponent. If you play through the transcript of any game between experts, you are\nlikely to find at least a few defensive moves.\nQuestion: What is the main idea of the passage?\nAnswer:","output":"Defensive plays in Othello."}
{"input":"likely to find at least a few defensive moves.\nThere are essentially three types of defensive moves. The first type is to flip\nsome of your opponent\u2019s pieces to take away access to his good move. A simple\nexample is shown in Diagram 7-1. Here, White is threatening to take the a8 corner,\nwhich is clearly a good move. However, if Black makes a defensive play at g8, flip-\nping the white disc on f8, he can deny White access to the corner.\nThe second type of defensive move is to play where your opponent wants to\nplay.  In Diagram 7-2, White would like to take the a8 corner. The only way to prevent\nhim from doing so is for Black to take the corner himself. In this case, taking the\ncorner is attractive for Black as well, but in other circumstances it pays to play in your\nopponent\u2019s spot, even if it is a relatively loud move.\nThe third type of defensive move is to somehow make the opponent\u2019s good\nmove less attractive. In Diagram 7-3, White has a good move to f8. There is no way to\ntake away White\u2019s access to f8, but Black can make the move much less attractive by\nplaying f7. Now if White plays f8, it would flip the entire f-column.\nDiagram 7-1\nDiagram 7-2\nDiagram 7-3\nBlack to move\nBlack to move\nBlack to move\na\n1\nb\n2\nc\n3\nd\n4\ne\n5\nf\n6\ng\n7\nh\n8\n1\na\n1\nb\n2\nc\n3\nd\n4\ne\n5\nf\n6\ng\n7\nh\n8\na\n1\nb\n2\nc\n3\nd\n4\ne\n5\nf\n6\ng\n7\nh\n8\n42\nOthello: A Minute to Learn...A Lifetime to Master\nDiagram 7-4\nDiagram 7-5\nDiagram 7-6\nWhite to move\nBlack to move\nWhite to move\nQuestion: What is the best way to prevent White from taking the a8 corner in Diagram 7-2?\n===\nThe answer to the above question is","output":"Black to take the corner himself"}

In Diagram 7-12, White plays c3 himself.\nAs the above examples suggest, when you opponent is threatening to make a\nvery good move, the best move will usually be a defensive move. In a position such\nas Diagram 7-10, Black\u2019s move to c3 is so good that White absolutely must prevent\nhim from moving there.

While that example was rather dramatic, even rather\nsubtle defensive plays can be effective. For example, in Diagram 7-13, Black has a\ngood move at f6.

Now it is too late for White to play g6, because it\nflips the disc on f5. White will not get a move to g5 as he could in Diagram 7-16,\nbecause Black will use the f5 disc to move there himself.\nDiagram 7-19 shows an example where it is important to consider both offense\nand defense. At first glance, c2 is the obvious choice for Black (Diagram 7-20). It is\na very quiet move, flipping only internal discs, and leaves White with no new op-\ntions.  However, considering defense as well as offense, Black has a much better\nmove, namely b5 (Diagram 7-21)!

Before examining this theory, we need to\ndefine the term region. As the name implies, a region refers to an empty area of the\nboard, usually (although not always) including a corner, separate from other empty\nsquares. In Diagram 8-1, the board has been broken up into four separate regions: 3\nsquares in the upper left, 8 squares in the upper right, 3 squares in the lower right, and\n7 squares in the lower left.\nQuestion: What is the name of the theory?\nAnswer:","output":"Parity"}
{"input":"Read the following context and answer the question.\nContext: 7 squares in the lower left.\nThe basic idea behind parity is that, when there is a region with an even number\nof squares left to be filled, it is usually better to play into the region last. That is, you\nwant your opponent to play into the region first, after which you follow, hopefully\nflipping back some of the pieces that your opponent just captured. In Diagram 8-2, it\nmight appear obvious that Black would want to move first, taking the h1 corner and\nsaving the adjacent four black discs. White would then take the last move at g1,\nleaving Black with 37 discs (Diagram 8-3).\nNow suppose that it is White to move first in Diagram 8-2. White has no choice\nbut to play h1 (Diagram 8-4). Black takes the last move at g1 (Diagram 8-5). As\nshown in Diagram 8-5, this leaves Black with 38 discs, one more than in Diagram 8-\n3!  Perhaps you are wondering \u201cwhat is the big deal about one disc\u201d? The point is that\neven when it looked like Black wanted to go first, in fact he was better off going\nsecond. In many positions, such as Diagram 8-6,  the difference between playing first\nand playing second is the difference between winning and losing.\nDiagram 8-1\nDiagram 8-2\nDiagram 8-3\nWhite to move\nBlack H1, White G1\na\n1\nb\n2\nc\n3\nd\n4\ne\n5\nf\n6\ng\n7\nh\n8\na\n1\nb\n2\nc\n3\nd\n4\ne\n5\nf\n6\ng\n7\nh\n8\na\n1\nb\n2\nc\n3\nd\n4\ne\n5\nf\n6\ng\n7\nh\n8\n48\nOthello: A Minute to Learn...A Lifetime to Master\nDiagram 8-4\nDiagram 8-5\nDiagram 8-6\nWhite H1\nBlack G1\nDiagram 8-7 shows an example of even number theory with four squares left.\nQuestion: The author probably believes that\nAnswer:","output":"the player who plays second has a better chance of winning"}

Thus, from the beginning\nof the game, even-number theory is working in favor of White. If the game proceeds\nwithout any passes, then White will get the last move of the game on move 60.\nAs noted earlier, in Diagram 8-6, whichever side plays first will lose. Even num-\nber theory tells us that if no passes occurred during the game, then it must now be\nBlack\u2019s turn, because there are an even number of empty squares. The only way it\ncould be White\u2019s turn would be if there was one pass (or some odd number of passes).\nSimilarly, in Diagram 8-11, it is not merely a coincidence that it is Black\u2019s turn to\nmove.\nWhile the above examples might make it appear that White starts the game with\na big advantage, there are ways for Black to make even number theory work in his\nfavor. For example, Diagram 8-13 shows a position from a game played at the 1982\nWorld Championship. Black was played by Kunihito Tanida from Japan, who went\non to win the tournament. Up until this point there were no passes, and there are an\neven number of empty squares, so it must be Black\u2019s turn.

{"input":"Read the following context and answer the question.\nContext: sometimes translated as \u201cset moves\u201d or \u201cbrilliant moves\u201d. Tesujis are basically just\ngood moves in certain positions that arise often enough to merit special attention.\nKnowledge of tesujis allows you not only to spot them easily when they are available,\nbut also to look ahead and set them up, or avoid giving your opponent a chance to use\nthem. This chapter looks at tesuji involving corner attacks, while Chapter 10 exam-\nines swindles and other tesuji.\nThe basic idea behind all of the corner attack tesuji is to make a move which\nthreatens to take a corner.  This forces the opponent to either make a move that elimi-\nnates the threat,   or give up the corner. When both of these options are bad for the\nopponent, then the corner attack will be an effective move. However, it is important\nto keep in mind that there are circumstances under which your opponent can afford to\nsimply give up the corner, in which case the corner attack may be a bad move.\nForcing your opponent to create a wall\nDiagram 9-1 shows one pattern (similar to Diagram 5-11) that often occurs in\nbeginner\u2019s games. White has just played b8, giving Black a golden opportunity to\nattack the a8 corner by playing e8 (Diagram 9-2).  In this case, the a8 corner is ex-\ntremely valuable for Black, as it would allow him to jump to the a1 corner as well. In\norder to avoid losing the corner, White must respond with f8, forming a huge wall\nacross the board (Diagram 9-3).\nDiagram 9-1\nDiagram 9-2\nDiagram 9-3\nBlack to move\nQuestion: What is the main point of the text?\nAnswer:","output":"to discuss tesuji"}

White\u2019s best move is\nto limit the effectiveness of Black\u2019s e8 threat by playing g6 (Diagram 9-6). Now if\nBlack plays e8, White can respond f8 without flipping the discs at f4 and f5.  How-\never, Black can continue with h6, flipping the disc at f6 back to Black and reestablish-\ning the threat of e8.\nForcing your opponent to flip your poison discs\nDiagram 9-7 shows a typical example of this tesuji.

In that case, Black can follow up with\nb7, in some sense sacrificing the a8 corner again while still threatening to capture the\nh8 corner.\nStoner trap\nThis tesuji is named after John Stoner, one of the founding members of the US\nOthello Association. I have saved this corner attack tesuji for last because it is more\ncomplicated than the other tesuji that I have presented so far. When successfully\nimplemented, the trap guarantees the capture of a corner, but there are many circum-\nstances under which the trap fails, some of which are very subtle. Further, as with all\nof the corner attack tesuji, it is important to keep in mind how much must be sacri-\nficed to set up the trap, and balance that against the value of the corner gained.\na\n1\nb\n2\nc\n3\nd\n4\ne\n5\nf\n6\ng\n7\nh\n8\na\n1\nb\n2\nc\n3\nd\n4\ne\n5\nf\n6\ng\n7\nh\n8\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\na\n1\nb\n2\nc\n3\nd\n4\ne\n5\nf\n6\ng\n7\nh\n8\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n62\nOthello: A Minute to Learn...A Lifetime to Master\nDiagram 9-25 shows the basic setup for a Stoner trap.

They focus so much on the tesuji that they forget\nto think about whether or not it works out to their advantage.  For example, consider\nDiagram 9-31. Here, Black can play a Stoner trap with b7. This move will eventually\nlead to black capturing h8, but how much is h8 worth? Since Black has an unbalanced\nedge, if he takes h8, White will be able to wedge at h7, winning the h1 corner. Further,\nplaying b7 leaves White with a nice quiet move at e2, which breaks the diagonal and\neventually will allow White to take a8 and the left edge (see Diagram 9-32).\nIt is far better for Black to simply play the quiet move e2 (Diagram 9-33), play-\ning where White would like to play, and leaving b7 as a powerful threat. White could\ngrab a diagonal with g7 (Diagram 9-34), but now Black takes the other diagonal with\nb7, and White is dead (Diagram 9-35).

As discussed in\nChapter 5, there are many situations where two squares form a pair: two squares such\nthat if a player moves to one the squares, the opponent\u2019s best move is normally to\nmove to the other. A swindle occurs when a player moves into the pair, but the oppo-\nnent does not have a legal move to the other square of the pair, allowing the first\nplayer to get both moves in the pair. There are situations where a player can get both\nmoves in a pair because the opponent does not want to move into the other half of the\npair; a swindle occurs only when the opponent can not move into the other half.\nSwindles involving corner\/C-square pairs are the most common type of swindle,\nand often the most devastating. In Diagram 10-1, a1 and b1 form a pair. If Black plays\na1, White will want to wedge at b1, winning the h1 corner-- presumably that is why\nWhite played to b2 in the first place. However, in this case, Black can \u201cswindle\u201d\nWhite, moving to a1 without giving White access to b1. Black can later move to b1\nQuestion: Why did White play to b2?\nAnswer:","output":"to wedge at b1"}
{"input":"Read the following article and answer the question.\nArticle: White, moving to a1 without giving White access to b1. Black can later move to b1\nand wins easily. This situation can often be set up by using a corner attack to semi-\nforce the opponent to take the corner on the opposite end of the diagonal. In Diagram\n10-2, Black can win the game by attacking the h1 corner with h7 (Diagram 10-3)! If\nWhite plays h8, he will create many stable discs, but the b2-g7 diagonal will become\nall White. This allows Black to take a1 without offering White access to b1, which is\nenough to win the game. Of course, White can play somewhere else, but then Black\nfollows through on his attack, winning two edges with h1.\nDiagram 10-1\nDiagram 10-2\nDiagram 10-3\nBlack to move\nBlack to move\nWhite to move\na\n1\nb\n2\nc\n3\nd\n4\ne\n5\nf\n6\ng\n7\nh\n8\na\n1\nb\n2\nc\n3\nd\n4\ne\n5\nf\n6\ng\n7\nh\n8\na\n1\nb\n2\nc\n3\nd\n4\ne\n5\nf\n6\ng\n7\nh\n8\n1\n70\nOthello: A Minute to Learn...A Lifetime to Master\nDiagram 10-4\nDiagram 10-5\nDiagram 10-6\nBlack to move\nWhite to move\nBlack to move\nDiagram 10-4 shows another swindle in which one side gets both a corner and\nthe adjacent C-square.

Black will be able to play b1 on his next turn, winning easily.

{"input":"Read the following context and answer the question.\nContext: common way to set up this swindle is to \u201cextract\u201d the discs the opponent needs to\ngain access to the C-square. In Diagram 10-6, Black should begin with e7, extracting\nthe white disc on b4 (Diagram 10-7). Then, on his next move, Black can extract the\nwhite disc on b5, setting up the swindle. For example, if White plays f7 (Diagram 10-\n8), Black can follow with d7 (Diagram 10-9).\nIn the examples above, the swindles involved taking a corner without giving the\nopponent access to the adjacent C-square. When this swindle is not available, it is\nsometimes possible to play the swindle in the opposite order, taking the C-square\nwithout offering the opponent access to the adjacent corner. For example, suppose\nthat in Diagram 10-9, White sees that he is going to be swindled, and plays to b7 in an\nattempt to gain access to b1 after Black takes the a1 corner (Diagram 10-10).\nDiagram 10-7\nDiagram 10-8\nDiagram 10-9\nWhite to move\nBlack to move\nWhite to move\na\n1\nb\n2\nc\n3\nd\n4\ne\n5\nf\n6\ng\n7\nh\n8\na\n1\nb\n2\nc\n3\nd\n4\ne\n5\nf\n6\ng\n7\nh\n8\na\n1\nb\n2\nc\n3\nd\n4\ne\n5\nf\n6\ng\n7\nh\n8\n1\na\n1\nb\n2\nc\n3\nd\n4\ne\n5\nf\n6\ng\n7\nh\n8\n1\na\n1\nb\n2\nc\n3\nd\n4\ne\n5\nf\n6\ng\n7\nh\n8\n3\na\n1\nb\n2\nc\n3\nd\n4\ne\n5\nf\n6\ng\n7\nh\n8\n2\nTesuji Part II\n71\nIn Diagram 10-10, White\u2019s move to b7 makes the entire b-column white.

However,\nthe pattern of the four empty squares, as well as the fact that black has access to the\ncorner, allows Black to pull off a swindle. Black\u2019s winning move is g8! (Diagram 10-\n23). No matter how White plays, Black takes h8 and White has to pass. With this\ntesuji in mind, look at Diagram 10-24.

Black has just played a6, inviting white to play a5 (Diagram 10-29).\nWhile a5 is a quiet move for White, it flips the disc on c5, allowing Black to play a3\nwithout flipping b4 (Diagram 10-30). As in Diagram 10-26, this leaves a difficult\nchoice between taking a bad edge with a7, or allowing Black to gain a tempo with a4.\nLandau maneuver\nThis tesuji is named after Ted Landau, a former U.S. Champion. The position in\nDiagram 10-31 is from a postal game where Landau played Black. While Black has\nseveral moves which are good enough to win, Landau found a5!!, a shocking move\nwhich crushes White (Diagram 10-32). The point of this is move is that if White takes\nthe a1 corner, Black continues with a7, making the entire b-column black (Diagram\n10-33). If White continues with a8 (perfect play), he can not secure a disk on the b-\ncolumn.

In many ways it is similar to feeding the opponent moves in order\nto get parity in the endgame (see Chapter 8). Diagram 10-34 shows the basic pattern.\nNot only has White run completely out of moves, but Black also has a free move\navailable at b2. Black can take full advantage of the situation by playing f8! (Diagram\n10-35). At first, this appears to be a bad move, because White can simply wedge at\ne8. However, Black now takes his free move at b2, and White is forced to \u201cunwedge\u201d\nwith g8, giving Black the h8 corner (Diagram 10-36). Of course, in Diagram 10-35,\nWhite can (and should) play f7, but this leaves Black with another free move at e8.\nDiagonal grab to get 3 of 4 in corner\nThis tesuji appears with great frequency, usually\nlate in the midgame or early in the endgame.

As noted\nin Chapter 4, novice players really do not have to worry that much about openings.\nHowever, having well prepared book openings becomes vital as you come up against\nstronger players. Rather than a long list of moves to be studied, this chapter is meant\nto teach you how to go about developing openings of your own.\nIf you have played even a few dozen games of Othello, you have probably no-\nticed the same patterns being repeated in the first moves of the game. If you remem-\nber what you did the last time you saw a certain position, you might make the same\nmove without really thinking about it. Or, perhaps the move you used last time did\nnot work out well, and you started to look for some alternative. While simply playing\ngames  will eventually give you a feel for which moves are good and which are bad,\ndeveloping an opening book with the aid of computer analysis can make this process\nmuch easier and more effective.\nExample of developing an opening\nSuppose that you are black and played the opening shown in Diagram 11-1.\nYour opponent chose to play the \u201cchimney\u201d opening (6. d6), resulting in Diagram 11-\n2, at which point you had no idea what to play next.

The next time someone plays the chimney, you can play g4 without\nhaving to think about it. That is all well and good, but you should be at least a little bit\ncurious about what White will do in response to your g4 move. In Diagram 11-3,\nWhite has seven moves to choose from; searching the Thor database (see Appendix\nfor details) reveals that all of these moves have been played at least once. Ideally, we\nwould like to know what to do against each of White\u2019s possible responses. We could\ntry each move for White, then ask the computer for a suggested reply as Black. Our\nbook would then look like:\na\n1\nb\n2\nc\n3\nd\n4\ne\n5\nf\n6\ng\n7\nh\n8\n6\na\n1\nb\n2\nc\n3\nd\n4\ne\n5\nf\n6\ng\n7\nh\n8\n7\na\n1\nb\n2\nc\n3\nd\n4\ne\n5\nf\n6\ng\n7\nh\n8\n8\na\n1\nb\n2\nc\n3\nd\n4\ne\n5\nf\n6\ng\n7\nh\n8\n9\na\n1\nb\n2\nc\n3\nd\n4\ne\n5\nf\n6\ng\n7\nh\n8\n8\na\n1\nb\n2\nc\n3\nd\n4\ne\n5\nf\n6\ng\n7\nh\n8\n9\na\n1\nb\n2\nc\n3\nd\n4\ne\n5\nf\n6\ng\n7\nh\n8\n8\na\n1\nb\n2\nc\n3\nd\n4\ne\n5\nf\n6\ng\n7\nh\n8\n9\n6. d6 \nOur move\n 8. e2\nOur move\n(Four other move 8\u2019s not shown)\nQuestion: What is probably true about the author?\n===\nThe answer to the above question is","output":"The author likes to play Othello."}

For example, if White plays 8. d3 and you make\nyour prepared move 9. c3, this leaves White with quite a few reasonable looking\noptions for move 10. Looking the position up in the database shows that 7 different\nmoves have been used at move 10. You could again ask the computer to find a good\nmove against each of these 7 moves. The problem though is that if you put in every\npossible response to each of your moves, the size of your opening book will grow\nexponentially. If your opponent always has 7 possible moves to choose from then the\nnumber of lines that you would have to remember will grow to 7x7 = 49, then 7x7x7=\n343, then 7x7x7x7= 2401 and so on. To put that in perspective, when I won the World\nChampionship my entire opening book with both colors had around 300 lines. Even\nfor a computer program, which might have a million lines in its opening book, it is\nimpossible to include everything.\nThus, it is important to be very selective when choosing what to put into your\nopening book.

The cheat sheets are color\nspecific\u2014 if there is a certain opening that I might play with either color, it will\nappear once in the section with black openings and again in the section with white\nopenings.  When I am building a new opening, I will put all of the research into the\nlarge book. Once the research is finished, I decide which lines to put onto the cheat\nsheets, and then try to memorize those lines.\nOf course, you still must figure out what openings to research in the first place.\nFor players who are just starting to learn openings, the obvious place to start is with\nthe games that you actually play. Naturally, in order to do that, you must keep tran-\nscripts of your games, or at least record the openings. Even if you are just playing\nsome informal games, it pays to keep track of your games. Have a computer analyze\nyour games and find your mistakes in the opening. In this manner, you can build up\nyour book one move at a time.\nFor anyone striving to become a world-class player, it is important to take a\nmore systematic approach to opening research, including studying openings that you\nhave not actually played before. Below I will try to make the process more concrete,\nbut first I want to offer a \u201cbig picture\u201d perspective that might help guide you in your\nopening research.\n82\nOthello: A Minute to Learn...A Lifetime to Master\nQuestion: What does the author probably think about the cheat sheets?\n===\nThe answer to the above question is","output":"They are helpful"}
{"input":"opening research.\n82\nOthello: A Minute to Learn...A Lifetime to Master\nThe perfect game\nSpeculation on which side would win a perfectly played game of Othello seems\nto be as old as the game itself. As even number theory was developed in the 1980\u2019s, it\nseemed that the advantage of the last move gave White a slight edge. Now with the\nbenefit of strong computer programs, it appears that a perfectly played game of Oth-\nello would end in a draw. While it will be a long time before computers are powerful\nenough to prove this conclusively, until someone comes up with a way to win for one\nside or the other, we might as well accept it as though it was fact.\nOne important conclusion of opening research is that while there are many ways\nto play for White, Black has very few choices that lead to a draw. For example, Dia-\ngrams 11-5 and 11-5 show one opening sequence which appears to lead to a draw.\nBlack could change the order of moves 3 and 5, but other than this there are no choices\nexcept for 7. f6, which is also a draw. At move 10, White has three moves that main-\ntain a draw (b4, e3, and e6), and in response to each of these Black again has only one\ndrawing move. In the game shown in Diagram 11-3, Black effectively has no choices,\nother than move order (e.g., moves 55\/56 could be made before moves 53\/54 without\nchanging the outcome of the game) throughout the entire game.

How-\never, before you sit down to memorize this game, I should point out a couple of\nproblems.

{"input":"Read the following article and answer the question.\nArticle: these positions, it is more difficult to play white than black; in games between human\nplayers of equal strength, Black will win more often than White.\nGiven all this, deciding on what book openings to use is not simply a matter of\nchoosing what are theoretically the best moves. Instead, in each particular game, you\nmust choose the moves that will give you the best chance of winning the game. There\nare many factors to consider: your strengths and weakness, those of your opponent,\nhow many openings you are able to memorize, what openings your opponent knows,\nthe time limit for the game, and so on. Choosing openings is thus more of an art than\na science. What works for me probably would not work for you, and what worked in\nthe last game might not work in the next one. There are, however, three general prin-\nciples that you may find useful.\n1. Choose uncommon openings\nSince there are no openings that lead to a forced win, and you can not expect to\nplay perfectly, in order to win your opponent must make more mistakes than you do.\nThus, we want to maximize the chances of our opponents making a bad move, and\noften the best way of doing that is to play openings that they have not seen before.\nAs noted above, in Diagram 11-6, White has four choices at move 22 which lead\nto a draw.  Of these, e8 is by far the most common move\u2014 for quite some time, it was\nbelieved that this move led to a win for White. Even after it was discovered that e8\nQuestion: The best title for this passage is   _  .\nAnswer:","output":"Choosing Openings"}
{"input":"Read the following article and answer the question.\nArticle: believed that this move led to a win for White. Even after it was discovered that e8\nwas actually draw, it remained the most common move. Naturally, anyone playing\nthis opening with Black would know what to do against this move. Sometime in 1998\nI saw several computer games with d1 at move 22 that led to good results for White.\nAfter studying it I started playing this move, and won several games in a row with it\nas my opponents had not seen it before. In theory, e8 is just as good as d1, but at least\nat that time, d1 was much less common, and much more effective.\n2. Choose openings which are easy to learn\nAnother way to make things difficult for your opponent is to play openings which\noffer a lot of good choices for your color, but few choices for your opponent. For\nexample, while the sequence in Diagram 11-4 is theoretically the best opening for\nBlack, White has a lot of good choices while Black does not. This means that in order\nto play this opening well with Black, you must study all of White\u2019s options, whereas\nyour opponent need only study one of the lines. This is a heavy price to pay just to get\na theoretical draw.\n84\nOthello: A Minute to Learn...A Lifetime to Master\nCompare this to an opening where Black has a slightly inferior position, but\nBlack has a lot of viable options, while in response to each of these options White has\nonly one move which maintains the advantage. In this case, you need only remember\nQuestion: Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage?\nAnswer:","output":"Playing openings with few good choices for your color is a good way to win the game."}
{"input":"Read the following article and answer the question.\nArticle: only one move which maintains the advantage. In this case, you need only remember\na few sequences, while your opponent would have to know many. In my experience,\nif you prepare such an opening, even world-class players are unable to maintain the\nadvantage for the entire game. Eventually you gain the advantage by knowing the\nopening to greater depth than your opponents.\n3. Do not accept worse than a minus 4 position\n As noted above, playing unusual openings is a good way to get your opponent\nout of his opening book. Sometimes, however, the reason an opening is uncommon is\nsimply that it is bad. In my experience, it is rarely worthwhile to play an opening\nwhich computer analysis indicates is worse than minus 4 discs. The problem with\nsuch an opening is it usually opens up a lot of reasonable responses by your oppo-\nnent\u2014 even if your opponent makes a mistake, it may still leave you with a losing or\nat best even position. There are plenty of openings to choose from which are both\nrarely played and close to even, so there is no need to intentionally play bad moves\nthat leave you with a significant disadvantage. By the same token, when deciding on\nwhich of your opponent\u2019s options to prepare for, it usually does not pay to look at\npositions where you are ahead by more than 4 discs; if you get ahead by that much the\nopening has done its job.\nTrade-off between goals\nIn general, there is a trade-off between the above-mentioned principles.

{"input":"Read the following article and answer the question.\nArticle: In general, there is a trade-off between the above-mentioned principles. Since\neveryone wants openings which are good and easy to learn (principles 2 and 3), most\nof these openings have been played before and are well known (violating principle 1).\nStill, there are always new moves to try if you look for them carefully. Sometimes a\ngood opening falls out of favor for a while, at which point people start to forget about\nit, offering a chance to surprise someone with it.\nIt is certainly possible to live only by principle 2 and be successful with open-\nings even when they are well known. Some people specialize in certain openings,\nplaying them in every single game for years. Even if you study the opening, they will\nknow it better than you do, and thus have a good chance of beating you. This sort of\nstrategy will naturally lead to long book openings, and a lot of very close positions\ngoing into the endgame.  It is thus suited to someone who is good at memorizing\nopenings and at counting in the endgame (see Chapter 13).\nSomeone who hates studying openings but is strong in the midgame would nor-\nmally focus only on principle 1 and choose to play unusual openings, even if it means\nBook openings\n85\ntaking a slightly inferior position out of the opening.

Rather,\nyou simply want to force your opponent out of his book and try to win by out-playing\nhim the rest of the game. If you are substantially better than your opponent at the\nmidgame and endgame, taking a position which is inferior by 4 discs is not an unrea-\nsonable price to pay.\nLooking back at history, I would argue that no one who has taken an extreme\napproach to openings has ever become World Champion. No matter how strong you\nare in the rest of the game, if you always play bad openings to force your opponents\nout of book, it is difficult to come from behind and win a high percentage of games. If\nyou take the other extreme and try to memorize commonly played computer moves\nuntil move 60, you end up with a lot of very close games at move 40, and again it is\nhard to win a high percentage of games.

We could simply choose the move with the best evaluation, but\nkeep in mind principles 1 and 2. \u201cFrequency\u201d is the percentage of games (in the Thor\ndatabase) in which each move was chosen. Usually, the lower the percentage, the\nbetter the chances are for knocking your opponent out of his opening book. Note that\nthere is some decision involved in which games to include in the analysis. I would\nargue that any game more than 10 years old is probably irrelevant, and 5 years or even\n2 years could be the cutoff.\n\u201cBranches better than -2\u201d indicates the number of White\u2019s choices at move 8\nthat WZebra rates better than -2.00. This gives some indication of how many moves\nwe will have to include if we want to extend our book to move 9. In practice, we\nwould normally want to look further out along the tree to see how many good options\neach side has. Again, by principle 2, we want a lot of options for Black, and few\noptions for White. Note that -2 as the cutoff is arbitrary; for some openings I might\nuse zero, for others -4 would make more sense.\n86\nOthello: A Minute to Learn...A Lifetime to Master\nIn that regard, the column \u201cwhite found decent reply\u201d shows the percentage of\nQuestion: What is probably true about the author?\nAnswer:","output":"He is a computer programmer"}

Again, this gets at the issue of how many lines we\nwill need to extend our opening book to move 9 or beyond.

In Diagram 12-5, Black has an unbalanced edge, and if Black opens up the\nsouth, White could eventually end up with a good move at b7.

{"input":"White wants to try to gain some tempos by exploiting Black\u2019s bad shape to the east,\nideally initiating play with g6, then following with h5 and g4.

Notice how this links all of the white discs together, which is often a\nsign of good shape.\nBlack has many possible moves in Diagram 12-6. Either e1 or e7 would exploit\nthe fact that the e-column is now white. Playing c2 would deny White access  to g6, at\nleast temporarily. Other possibilities are d1, d2, c7, d8, and e8.

If\nBlack does nothing defensively (playing d1, e1, d2, or c7), then White will have a\ngood move to g6. If Black tries c2, then simply playing d2 is certainly good shape.

Certainly, simply taking an edge any time one is available is not\ngoing to be a work against someone who has a reasonable idea of proper strategy.\nWhile there is no true consensus, most experts would probably agree with the\nidea that taking edges is good for gaining tempos in the midgame, but often leads to\nproblems later in the game.

In terms of the current discussion, we might think of\nmost edge positions as bad shape, even if they are not immediately subject to attack.\nIf taking edges makes bad shapes, then you have to read ahead to decide whether an\nedge is worth taking.\nIn Diagram 12-15, Black holds two edges which are adjacent in the sense that\nthey are both connected to the h8 corner.  Holding adjacent edges can be a powerful\nstrategy, and experience shows that it is usually better to occupy adjacent edges rather\nthan opposing edges. While the bottom and right edges in Diagram 12-15 are both\nbad shape, White has no way to attack them.  In the process of taking adjacent edges,\nit is often possible to gain tempos, forcing your opponent to build walls.\nIn some cases, it is possible to completely run your opponent out of moves in the\nmidgame by grabbing the long diagonal connecting adjacent edges.

In Diagram 13-4, Black has 26 + 14 = 40 discs; Black started with\n26 discs, got an additional five on the bottom edge (b8, c8, d8, e8, and f8), five on the\ndiagonal (c7, d6, e5, f4 and g3), and four on column b (b4, b5, b6, and b7; note that b8\nwas already included above).

Above, we compared the number of discs at the end of the game, for\na8 and b8, to determine that b8 was better. Another way to choose a move is to instead\ncalculate the number of discs gained or lost. Comparing Diagram 13-1 and Diagram\n13-3, we see that at the end of the game, Black will gain 6 discs by playing a8 (a4, a5,\na6, a7, a8, and c6). Comparing Diagram 13-1 and Diagram 13-5 shows Black will\ngain 7 discs by playing b8 (8 new discs on c7, d6, e5, f4, g3, b4, b5 and b6 less one\ndisc lost at g8). Again, since the gain is larger for b8 (+7) than for a8 (+6), we know\nthat b8 is the better move.\n102\nOthello: A Minute to Learn...A Lifetime to Master\nThe main advantage of using the plus\/minus method is that there is no need to\ncount the number of Black discs in Diagram 13-1.

The main advantages of counting\ndiscs only become apparent as you start to count longer sequences. Often the reason\nto count is not to determine the best move, but to find a move which is good enough\nto win. If you are counting discs, and you find a sequence that will leave you with 33\ndiscs, then you know you can win. If you find a sequence that is +10, is that enough to\nwin? The only way to know is to count the number of discs in the original position,\nwhich takes away the main advantage of the plus\/minus method. In fact, when I count\nwith plus\/minus, I usually have a \u201ctarget\u201d score which tells me whether I have enough\nto win. In our example, starting with 26 discs, the target would be +7; that is, if I find\na move which scores +7 or better, then I know I can win. However, in a long endgame\ncount in which you consider many possible sequences, it can be hard to keep the\ntarget in mind.

Using cancellation, we mentally pair the discs gained (a7 and a8) with\nthe discs lost (c5 and c6) and immediately get the result of 0 (see Diagram 13-7). To\ncount out the sequence Black b8, White a8, we can cancel four discs gained (e.g., c7,\nd6, e5, and f4) with four discs lost (c6, d5, e4, and f3), leaving one extra disc gained\non g3.

The rest of the moves, shown in Diagram 13-23, are obvious and\noffer Black no choices. It is also pretty easy to count this sequence.

If you are interested in becoming an\nexpert, or perhaps even the World Champion, this chapter will explain how to do it.\nPlay in tournaments\nWhile it is certainly possible to become a strong player by practicing against\nfriends, computers, or opponents on the Internet, nothing will raise the level of your\nplay as quickly as participating in tournaments. There is something special about the\natmosphere of a tournament, sitting face-to-face with your opponent in a game that\ncounts (if for nothing else than rating points) that can not be matched by playing\nelectronically. Not only does playing in a tournament give you a chance to play against\nexperts, but it can also spur your desire to improve. More importantly, playing in\ntournaments is a lot of fun!  Unlike some other strategy games, there are no profes-\nsional Othello players, and gambling is not common. As of this writing, the biggest\nprize is $3,000 for winning the World Championship, and most tournaments offer\nonly a trivial amount of prize money.  In general, people play in tournaments for the\nfun of it, and perhaps that is why the atmosphere is fairly relaxed.  The best way to\nfind a tournament near you is to contact the Othello Association in your country (see\nAppendix).\nIf the idea of playing in a tournament seems intimidating, keep in mind that\nQuestion: Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage?\nAnswer:","output":"Playing in a tournament is not fun."}
{"input":"Read the following article and answer the question.\nArticle: Appendix).\nIf the idea of playing in a tournament seems intimidating, keep in mind that\nOthello players are generally very friendly people, and are always happy to see new\nplayers coming to tournaments. If you are familiar with the ideas in Part I of this\nbook, you are certainly good enough to play in a tournament. In more than twenty\nyears of tournament play, I have never heard anyone complaining that their opponent\nwas too weak. By far the most common complaint about people coming to their first\ntournament is that they sometimes play the first couple of games and then just disap-\npear, which can ruin the pairings for the rest of the tournament.  Although rules vary,\na typical one-day tournament would consist of six rounds with a time limit of 25\nminutes per player. Adding in an hour for lunch and some time between rounds, it\nwill take 7 or 8 hours to finish the tournament. If you can not stay for the entire\ntournament, then at least speak to the tournament director before you enter.\n112\nOthello: A Minute to Learn...A Lifetime to Master\nThere are some extra rules which apply to tournament games. A device called a\n\u201cchess clock\u201d is used to keep track of the time used by each player. It has two clocks\nand two buttons which control its operation. The clocks are set to show the amount of\ntime allotted to each player. To begin the game, the player with white presses his\nbutton, which starts Black\u2019s clock counting down. Black makes his move, flips the\nQuestion: Which of the following is true about the tournament?\nAnswer:","output":"It is a one-day tournament."}
{"input":"Read the following article and answer the question.\nArticle: button, which starts Black\u2019s clock counting down. Black makes his move, flips the\ndiscs, and then presses his button, which stops his own clock and starts White\u2019s. If\none player\u2019s clock  runs all the way down to zero before he hits his button to complete\nhis last move, that player time defaults. Although the rules used for scoring games\nwith a time default vary, the player who runs out of time always loses, regardless of\nthe position on the board.\nIn a tournament game, if you touch a disc to a square where you have a legal\nmove, then you must move there. Thus Othello is not like some games where you are\nnot committed to making a move until you take your finger off the piece. Further, you\nmust use the same hand to place the disc on the board, flip the pieces, and hit your\nclock. When time is running short it may be tempting to flip with both hands to save\ntime, but the tournament director can impose a penalty on any player doing so.\nIf your opponent fails to flip all of the discs that he was supposed to, you have\nthe option of forcing him to correct his mistake. To do so, hit your button to start your\nopponent\u2019s clock and point out the discs that he failed to flip. If it is to your advan-\ntage, you are allowed to leave the board as it stands, even if your opponent realizes\nhis mistake after he hits his clock. By the same token, if you make a move, hit your\nclock, and then realize that you forgot to flip some discs, you are not entitled to flip\nQuestion: When a player runs out of time, he  _  .\nAnswer:","output":"loses the game"}
{"input":"Read the following article and answer the question.\nArticle: clock, and then realize that you forgot to flip some discs, you are not entitled to flip\nthe discs even if your opponent has not yet made his next move.\nPractice intensively\nOne of the reasons that playing in tournaments is so beneficial is that it forces\nyou to concentrate on Othello for several hours in a row. Just as intensive exercise\nsuch as weight lifting will make your body adjust by making your muscles bigger,\nintensive concentration on Othello makes your brain adjust. It is certainly possible to\nmake progress playing a little bit every day, but becoming a top player requires at\nleast occasional periods of intensive practice.\nIn my view, the key to playing Othello at a high level is the ability to read ahead\nand visualize what the board will look like after several moves. In fact, at the highest\nlevels of play, nearly all of the \u201cthinking\u201d taking place is visual. For example, scans\nof Japan\u2019s top Shogi (Japanese Chess) player showed activity concentrated in the\nvision center of his brain.\nThe first time that I was able to really \u201csee\u201d what the board would look like was\nduring the 1981 World Championship. I had practiced quite a lot in the month before,\nBecoming an expert\n113\nand then played 19 games over two days during the tournament. In the last game, I\nwas considering a move when quite literally I saw a diagonal of pieces turn from\nwhite to black. It looked as real to me as if the pieces had actually changed color. It\nQuestion: What is the author\u2019s attitude towards playing Othello intensively?\nAnswer:","output":"He thinks it is necessary."}
{"input":"Read the following article and answer the question.\nArticle: white to black. It looked as real to me as if the pieces had actually changed color. It\nwas not until much later that I was able to visualize this well on a consistent basis. In\nthe summer of 1987 I visited Japan and pretty much played Othello all day for 3\nweeks. By the end of that trip, when I looked at the board, it seemed to come alive, as\nthough I was watching a movie.\nPractice counting endgames\nAnother good way to improve your ability to visualize is to practicing counting\nendgames (see Chapter 13). In order to accurately count a sequence of moves in the\nendgame, you must correctly visualize all of the pieces that are added to the board or\nflipped. The level of concentration needed to do that is so high that you may find it\nextraordinarily tiring. In my experience, novice players are usually unable to main-\ntain this level of concentration for more than a minute or two. Pretty soon their eyes\nstart to glaze over, and it looks as though they need a nap. Although it might seem that\nthey are just getting bored, in actuality it is the strain of doing something they are not\nused to that makes them feel tired or that their eyes can not focus anymore.\nIn some ways, counting endgames is like running in an all-out sprint. At first,\nyou may find it difficult to count anything more than two empty squares. My advice\nwould be to slowly work your way up, at first practicing by counting the last two or\nQuestion: The author thinks that the novice players are unable to maintain the level of concentration because they   _  .\nAnswer:","output":"are not used to it"}
{"input":"Read the following article and answer the question.\nArticle: would be to slowly work your way up, at first practicing by counting the last two or\nthree moves of your games. As your ability to visualize improves, you will be able to\ncount positions with several empty squares. At that point, it will really start to pay to\ndevote more practice time to endgame counting. The Appendix describes software\nuseful for practicing endgames.\nRecord and review your games\nOne of the best ways to improve is to review your games. WZebra can analyze\nyour games and show you where you made mistakes and how much those mistakes\ncost you.  Of course, in order to review, you have to be able to remember the games\nyou play, and it is well worth the effort to take a transcript of your games as you play.\nSimply start with an empty 8x8 diagram, put in the initial four center discs, and then\nwrite in the moves as they are made. I usually use a small notebook containing graph\npaper, but it is not difficult to make your own transcript sheets using Excel or other\nsoftware.\nOne problem with taking transcripts is that in a timed game, it may seem like a\nwaste of precious seconds to record the moves. With practice, it should become pos-\nsible for you to write the transcript after the game is complete, without using a board.\nAt the 1987 All Japan Championship, Takeshi Murakami played in nine games, in-\n114\nOthello: A Minute to Learn...A Lifetime to Master\ncluding two tie-breaker games that were held with 5-minute time limits.

At first you might only be able to write down the first 10 moves, but as you practice\nyou will make it further and further until finally you are able to record the entire\ngame.\nReview transcripts of experts\u2019 games\nBesides the transcripts published in magazines such as Othello Quarterly, a large\ncollection of games is available over the Internet from the French Othello Federation\n(FFO, see Appendix). These games can be examined using WZebra. When reviewing\ntranscripts, I usually try to put myself in the shoes of one of the players, normally the\nstronger of the contestants. It is possible to think before every move, considering\nmoves for both sides, but this can get confusing, particularly if one of the players is\nnot very strong.

{"input":"Read the following article and answer the question.\nArticle: appropriately enough, the two strongest players in the world. Ben Seeley of the United\nStates and Makoto Suekuni of Japan finished 1-2 in the preliminary rounds of the\ntournament, and were the highest rated players in their respective countries. In the\nfirst game of the best 2-of-3 finals, Seeley, playing white, cruised to a 42-22 victory\n(see transcript). Suekuni thus needed to win the second game in order to get back in\nthe match, while another victory for Seeley would make him World Champion. By\nthe rules of the World Championship, the players reversed colors for the second game,\nwith Seeley playing Black and Suekuni playing White.\nPlayer profiles\nBen Seeley of the United States has achieved a meteoric rise through the ranks\nin his short career as an Othello player. His first tournament was in 2000, and by 2001\nhe was the U.S. champion. He went on to finish second at the World Championship in\n2002. Seeley is the strongest of what I call the \u201cnew breed\u201d of players, people who\nbecame experts mainly by playing over the Internet.\nMakoto Suekuni of Japan is the \u201cTiger Woods\u201d of Othello, having played well\nfrom a very young age. He won an open tournament at the age of 10, and has won\nevery major tournament at least once, including the All Japan Championship, Student\nMeijin, Meijin, Paris Open, Tokyo Open, and Mind Sport Olympiad. He won the\nWorld Championship in 1997.\na\n1\nb\n2\nc\n3\nd\n4\ne\n5\nf\n6\ng\n7\nh\n8\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\nQuestion: Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?\nAnswer:","output":"Seeley won the first game of the best 2-of-3 finals."}

Although Suekuni sometimes plays the diagonal, in recent years\nhe has mainly used the perpendicular.  Seeley continued with 3. f6, the most common\nchoice for Black against the perpendicular in recent years, although c6, d6, and e6 are\nall reasonable alternatives. At move 4, Suekuni again chose the most common move,\nf5. White could play e3 or even d2 here, but these moves leave Black with a small\nadvantage.\nAt move 5, Black has only one reasonable choice, namely e6, connecting his\npieces while splitting White\u2019s discs. Indeed it is the strength of this move which makes\n3. f6 so appealing for Black. These first five moves are called the \u201cTiger\u201d opening,\nsupposedly because the shape resembles a tiger (this is slightly easier to imagine if\nmove one is made at f5). At move 6, e3 is by far the most common move, playing\nquietly in the center of the board and setting up a threat to play f4. Occasionally\nplaying to the outside with d7 or even f7 is used as a \u201cchange-up\u201d by White when\ntrying to drive Black out of his opening book early in the game.\nDiagram 16-1\nDiagram 16-2\nDiagram 16-3\na\n1\nb\n2\nc\n3\nd\n4\ne\n5\nf\n6\nQuestion: Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?\nAnswer:","output":"Seeley chose the perpendicular opening at move 2."}

The most natural looking move is d6, flipping\ntwo discs in the center of the board, but as discussed in Chapter 11, this move tends to\ngive White a lot of viable variations in the opening. Seeley\u2019s choice, 7. c3, offers\nblack a lot of possibilities for his next few moves. At move 8, White usually tries to\nset up a good move on row 4 by playing f3, d2, or even e7. At move 9, Black must do\nsomething to prevent White from playing c4. Seeley chose to play there himself, but\nflipping the white disc on e4 by playing f4 or e2 are reasonable alternatives.\nAt move 10, Suekuni came through the middle with b4, the first move of the\ngame that flipped more than one disc.

In that case, the Black disc on c7\ncould allow White to use the four in the corner swindle (see Diagram 10-22). Another\nproblem with 28. b2 is that White can not flip the disc on d2, because this would\nallow Black a swindle by playing a2 without flipping b2. A third problem is that, as in\nthe actual game, a1-a2-b1 is likely to become an odd (3-square) region that White can\nnot move into, losing parity. At 30, White has little choice but to play f8, threatening\nto follow with f4. Seeley then played an excellent defensive move with 31. f2! If\nWhite now plays f4, it would flip d2, again giving Black a swindle with a2.\nSuekuni played 32. g5; the main appeal of this move is that it sets up a quiet\nmove to f7. Computer analysis reveals that 32.e2 was slightly better. Although e2\nwould flip the critical disc on d2, it makes a link with the black disc on f2, so that a\nBlack move to a2 would still flip b2. The game continued with Seeley playing 33. e8,\nallowing White to get in his quiet move at f7. Exchanging Black e8 for White f7\nreduced Seeley\u2019s advantage from  6 discs to 4 discs.

Before deciding which wing to attack, Black should\nexamine which corner (a1 or h8) is more valuable to him.

If White continues\nwith f8, it flips the disc on b4, making the entire b-column White. Black can\nnow play b8 without flipping b7.\nExercise 9-15 The trap fails when Black responds with a6.  Now if White\nplays d8, the b-column is entirely White, allowing Black to play b8 without\nflipping b7. However, it is worth noting that if White plays b8 instead of d8,\nBlack\u2019s only winning move is to play d8 himself. So, in some sense the trap\ndoes succeed in winning the h8 corner.\nChapter 10\nExercise 10-1 Black should play f2. While this move is loud, it sets up a very\nvaluable swindle. If White plays b2, Black first fills in at e1, and later can\nswindle White by playing b8 without flipping b7.

However, if White plays f2, then this results in the position\nshown in Exercise 12-1. Black gets in a good move at c2 and threatens b3\nfollowed by c4. WZebra indicates that the best move is f1, which at first glance\ndoes not seem appealing at all.  Not only does it offer Black a wonderful move\nat c4, but it also puts a piece on the edge opposite the edge White already\noccupies (c8-d8).  The value of playing f1 is mainly defensive. Black can not\nrespond with c2, because this would give White access to c4. Of course Black\ngets a good move in a c4, but after this neither b3 nor c2 is particularly good,\nand there is no way for Black to play to both. In the initial position, WZebra\neven prefers g4, denying Black access to c2, over f2. The difference between\nplaying f1, f2, or g4 is not big, but the point is that it is important to consider\nhow your opponent will exploit your bad shape.\n152\nOthello: A Minute to Learn...A Lifetime to Master\nExercise 12-4 Black\u2019s best move is, believe it or not, a2!

After b2, Black does not have a follow-up response to White\u2019s h4. The\nusual move would be to play a3, semi-forcing White to take a1, and then\nwedge at b1. In this case, however, playing b1 gives White access to d1.\nRather than b2, Black should begin with d1. If White responds with g1, then\nb2 becomes an attack on an unbalanced edge. If White breaks the diagonal\nwith h4, Black can play the a3-a1-b1 sequence and win the h1 corner.\nChapter 13\nExercise 13-1 Black begins with 32 discs. If Black plays h7, White responds\nwith h6, and Black gains just the disc on f7, finishing with 33 discs. If Black\ninstead plays h6, White responds with h7.

After Black plays\nd8, White gets swindled because he does not have access to e8, so Black\ngets this move as well.

It was begun in 1978 by a group of U.S. Othello\nplayers who had gathered to attend the World Othello Championship (held in New York\nCity that year). At the time, the Japanese dominated the World Championships (they still\ndo!) and it was clear to all who attended that the Japanese knew something about Othello\nthat remained largely a mystery to everyone else.

Jonathan Cerf, George Sullivan and the\nrest of the original USOA members set out to discover what that was. They were quite suc-\ncessful: Jonathan went on to become the 1980 World Champion, the first non-Japanese\nplayer to do so.\nImmediately after its inception, the USOA began the sponsorship of tournaments, es-\npecially the annual U.S. National Championship (the winner of which competes in the\nWorld Championship). The USOA (largely through the efforts of Jonathan and George)\nalso began publication of Othello Quarterly (OQ) as a means of disseminating informa-\ntion about Othello. At the present time, the USOA continues to serve the Othello commu-\nnity, maintaining a world wide membership of several hundred players.\nI was not one of the original members. However, I had been playing Othello for sever-\nal years when I first became aware of and joined the USOA in 1980. By studying articles\nin OQ, I set about to change what I discovered to be my largely wrong notions about\nOthello strategy. Eventually, I felt I had learned enough to attempt writing an article my-\nself. It appeared in the Winter 1980\/81 issue of OQ. Over the next several years, I contrib-\nuted more than a dozen articles to OQ. Along the way, I also became one of the USOA's\ntop-rated tournament players.\nIn 1984, I assumed the Editorship of OQ.

With the confidence from my tournament victories and the resources availa-\nble to me as Editor of OQ, I decided that now was an appropriate time to attempt a project\nof long-standing interest: to write an introductory handbook on Othello strategy and tac-\ntics.\nIt was clearly something that the USOA needed. It was becoming increasingly diffi-\ncult (and unrealistic to expect of new members) to learn the fundamental principles of\nOthello strategy by sorting through the ever increasing collection of largely unrelated arti-\ncles appearing in the back issues of OQ. A concise, synthesized, easily accessible single\nresource was the obvious alternative: a Beginner's Handbook, as it came to be called.\nAnother potential value of this project would be to serve as an antidote for all the misinfor-\nmation about Othello that has been printed in various books over the years. For example, a\nrecent book describing popular \"indoor games\" had the following to say about Othello: \"It\nis not easy to see ahead accurately more than a move or two...\" This is patently false, as the\ninformation presented in this book will demonstrate.\nWith all this in mind, I began to work on the Beginner's Handbook project. The result\nwas the original version of \"Othello: Brief & Basic,\" which appeared (starting in Spring\nof 1985) as a series of three articles published in separate issues of OQ over the course of a\nAccording to the above context, answer the following question.\nThe author wrote the handbook:","output":"before he went to the World Championship"}

The issues containing these articles were well received and subsequently became rec-\nommended reading for all new USOA members. There seemed to be sufficient mterest to\njustify revising Brief & Basic and combining the three parts into one integrated book.\nThus the revised edition of Othello: Brief & Basic was born.\nFor this revised edition, I added a table of contents and an index so as to make it easier\nto locate particular topics. I also added an appendix containing 11 game transcripts for fur-\nther study and analysis. On the other hand, I chose to eliminate the footnotes of the original\nversion \u2014 most of them references to relevant articles from previous issues of OQ \u2014 rather\nthan have them interrupt the flow of the text. As an alternative, I have included a separate\nreference section that contains a listing of almost all of the cited articles.\nOthello: Brief & Basic Vv\n\fThis is in no way meant to diminish the debt I owe to my fellow authors of OQ arti-\ncles.

{"input":"Handbook has also benefited from the work of still more people. In particular, I want to ex-\npress my gratitude to Brian Rose, David Shaman and the rest of the USOA's top tourna-\nment players (together with our Othello colleagues in other countries). It has been their\nskill and expertise that has \"pushed the envelope\" of what we know about Othello today.\nMy thanks similarly go to Clarence Hewlett, Dan & Kathe Spracklen, Charlie Heath, Peter\nFrey and the other computer programmers whose Othello programs have served as a much\nneeded source of analytical information, especially in the area of endgame play. As a result\nof the efforts of all these individuals, the level of play of tournament Othello in this coun-\ntry (as well as in the rest of the world!) has improved exponentially over the last 10 years.\nFinally, some comments and advice to readers who are approaching Brief & Basic for\nthe first time. It has been commented that this Handbook is neither as brief nor as basic as\nthe title would imply. As to its brevity, I can only say that it is considerably shorter than the\nmore \"complete\" Handbook that I first envisioned. To meet the time and space constraints\nof appearing within the pages of OQ, it necessitated that I leave much material out. Rather\nthan committing myself to a major expansion for this revision, I have maintained this ap-\nproach. At times this places an extra burden on the reader.

For example, one diagram often\nserves to illustrate several techniques, where clearly two or three would have made under-\nstanding the techniques easier. Similarly, there are several explanations of one or two sen-\ntences where one or two paragraphs might have helped clarify the matter more. I apologize\nfor this. My best advice to compensate for these possible weaknesses is - as stated in the\nHandbook - to lay out all the diagrammed positions on a board as you read and play out the\nmoves under discussion.\nAnother consequence of this emphasis on brevity is that many important ideas are\nonly mentioned in passing or omitted altogether. Sometimes I comment that a fuller under-\nstanding would require more space than I could give it. In the worst cases, I become quasi-\nmystical and refer to the necessity of practice and experience as a pre-condition for under-\nstanding. If the reader finds these explanations unsatisfactory, I again apologize. However,\nin a few cases (new to this revision), I discuss some of these additional topics in special\nsections labelled as \"digressions\" or \"notes.\"\nAs to how \"basic\" the Handbook is: It is certainly basic in the sense that it assumes no\nprior knowledge of Othello (other than perhaps a vague idea of the rules of the game).\nEven a novice player should be able to follow and implement all of the advice given in this\nQuestion: What is probably true about the author?\nAnswer:","output":"He is an expert at Othello"}

This is not a breezy tutorial than\ncan be skimmed in a couple of hours. It's probably best if it's studied a few pages at a time,\nand always with a board 1n front of you.\nThe material in Points #1 - #8 should be considered essential for all novice Othello\nplayers to know. Mastering the information in Points #9 - #16 (particularly the concept of\ntempo) should result in still a second important leap forward in playing ability.

Though they each\ndenounced the other as a fraud, they both probably derived their ideas from related pre-\nexisting games. Reversi remained popular over the next 20 years and then seemed to fade\nfrom view. It resurfaced in Japan, in the early 1970's, when Goro Hasegawa refined the\nrules of Reversi, making two significant changes (see below), and called the game Othello.\nOthello became very popular during the 1970's, with an annual World Championship be-\ngun in 1977 and National Championships held in many countries, including the United\nStates. The increase in interest in microcomputers in recent years has also contributed to a\nresurgence of mterest in Othello\/Reversi. This is because the nature of Othello (few rules,\nsymmetrical board, one type of piece) lends itself to writing computer programs that can\n\"play\" the game.

A game always begins with four discs placed\nas shown in Diagram 1. (This differs from\nthe rules of Reversi, which allows for any position of the four central discs).\n2. One player is assigned Black and always places his discs with the Black side up. The\nother player is White, and conversely places his discs with the White side up.\n3. Black always goes first with Black and White alternating turns thereafter.\n4. A legal move is defined as follows: a new disc is placed on a vacant square. This vacant\nsquare must be adjacent to at least one square already occupied by a disc of the oppo-\nnent's color. This new disc must also be placed so that in at least one direction (vertical-\nly, horizontally, or diagonally) the newly-placed disc, together with a disc of the\nplayer's color already on the board, brackets (or \"outflanks\") one or more discs of the\nopponent's color. The bracketed disc(s) are turned over (or \"flipped\") to become the\nsame color as the newly placed disc. If a newly-placed disc outflanks opponent's discs\nin several directions at once, all such discs are flipped.

For example, all possible legal\nmoves for Black's first turn are indicated with asterisks in Diagram 1 -- each choice\nwould result in the flipping of one or the other of the two white disks. For an example of\na move that flips more than one disc, turn to Diagram 4 for a moment. Here, a White\nmove to d7 would flip 4 discs: d4, d5, and d6 vertically and e6 diagonally.\n5. A player with no legal moves must \"pass.\" For every turn in which a player must pass,\nhis opponent continues to take turns, taking discs from the other player's \"tray\" as nec-\nessary. Thus, (unlike Reversi) a player cannot \"run out\" of discs.\n6. A player may not pass if he has a legal move available.\nOthello: Brief & Basic 1\n\f7. If neither player has a legal move, the game ends even if there are still vacant squares on\nthe board. Most often, the game ends when all 64 squares are filled.\n8. Once placed on the board, a disc is never moved again, though it may be flipped repeat-\nedly over the course of the game. A disc that currently has its white side facing up 1s\ncalled a white disc and vice versa.\nNotation & Terminology.

In the case of double diagrams (two grids\nwith an arrow between): the upper grid shows (1) the board configuration prior to the\nmove or sequence of moves under discussion (the unnumbered discs) and (2) the move or\nsequence of moves under discussion (the numbered discs); the lower grid shows the board\nconfiguration after the move or sequence of moves under discussion has been made. The\nnumbered discs indicate that you should place discs on the board in the numerical se-\nquence shown, flipping the appropriate discs as you do so.\nThe game of Othello is divided into three phases.

The irony of Othello (as well as many other abstract strategy\ngames) is that even though the entire board and all the pieces are in full view at all times,\nthe best move is often far from obvious. Deciding upon the \"night\" move can be analogous\nto hunting for buried treasure: you need to know (1) what it is you are looking for and (2)\nhow to go about finding it. These themes wind their way through every point in this book.\nFor example, Points #4, #5 & #9 focus on the general characteristics of a good move and\nthe importance of trying to visual the future consequences of a move. Specific suggestions\nas to how to recognize good moves in common midgame positions are made in Point #13\nand again in #16. The discussions of openings, endgames, and edge play offer other situa-\ntion specific recommendations. Point #21 finally deals with the difficult issue of how to\nfind the best move when (as often happens in real games) several of the \"rules\" discussed\nhere lead to conflicting or unclear advice.

This\nQuestion: The best title of the passage is   _  .\nAnswer:","output":"The Best Move"}
{"input":"Read the following article and answer the question.\nArticle: The object of Othello is to end the game with more discs than your opponent. This\nultimate goal is frequently translated, by many beginning players, into an immediate\ngoal throughout the game. That is, on each turn, a player will (with few exceptions) take\nthe move that flips the maximum number of discs. This has been clearly shown to be an\ninferior strategy. Actually, disc count is often irrelevant to who is ahead in a game. This\npoint can not be stated too strongly. In fact, players who consistently flip large numbers\nof discs early in the game are among the easiest opponents for experts to defeat! An ex-\n2 Othello: Brief & Basic\n\fample is in Diagram 2. Here, Black has only\none disc on the board, with only four moves\nleftin the game. Butif you play the game out, ,\nyou will find that Black gets all the remain-\ning moves and wins the game 40-24. Clearly,\nsimply having a lot of discs, even at such a\nlate point in the game, is not enough to assure\nvictory. Even games between experts may\nend with this sort of turn-around in the last\nfew moves (though usually not as dramatic as\nin this example).

It was not coin-\ncidental that the 4 empty squares in Diagram\n2 were all corner squares. A corner is im-\nportant because it can never be flipped. That\nis, itis a stable disc. Similarly, possession of Diagram 3: Black to move\ndiscs adjacent to a commer square (once the\ncorer has been occupied) often means that\nthe adjacent discs are stable as well. Thus in\nDiagram 3, when Black takes the h8 comer,\nall the discs in the g and h columns andinthe  ,\nseventh and eighth rows, suddenly become\nstable discs for Black. Black is well on the\nway to winning the game. In fact, possession\nof a comer is so critical in the beginning of\nthe game, that getting one almost always as-\nsures victory. Similarly, since the comers\nand the edge squares together add up to 28\nsquares, it is almost impossible to win with-\nout occupying at least some of these squares.\nAn implied corollary to the above princi-\nQuestion: In the game of go, the player who occupies the most squares at the end of the game is the winner.\nAnswer:","output":"not mentioned"}
{"input":"out occupying at least some of these squares.\nAn implied corollary to the above princi-\nples is that squares adjacent to corners are ex-\ntremely risky to occupy, at least until the cor-\nner itself has been occupied. This is because\nthese squares can become \"stepping stones\" ' . '\nfor your opponent to take the corner. This is Diagram 4: White to move\nOo som th f& WwW hi\nO\nee\n, Je\n, Je\neee\nOo a om Ch & WwW hi\nOthello: Brief & Basic 3\n\foOo -\u2014 mm oh & iW KI\noOo om  & iW hh\nespecially true of the X-squares. Taking an X-square early in the game, usually guaran-\ntees that the other player will get the adjacent comer. Such a situation is seen in Dia-\ngram 4. Itis White's turn, but no matter where White goes, Black will be able to flip the\ndisc on the X-square (g7) and take the h8 corner on his next move. Very simply, White\nshould never have gone to the g7 square at this stage of the game. There are similar\nproblems with C-squares (see Point #6), though they do not guarantee the opponent's\naccess to the corner nearly as often as X-squares do.\nAn incorrect, though commonly assumed, implication of the above discussion is that\nall squares on the board can be rated as to their absolute value. In this approach the cor-\nners are typically rated as the most valuable, the A and B edge squares as valuable (but\nless so than corners), the non-edge squares (particularly those adjacent to the edge) as\nstill less valuable, and the C- and X-squares as most risky.

Unfortunately, a player adopting this strategy will almost\nalways be defeated by a player using the winning strategies to be discussed in the next\nsections.\n[Note: Corners often diminish in value near the end of the game, and corner sacrific-\nes become quite common among expert players.

Ironically, the correct strategy typi-\ncally involves flipping a minimum number\nof discs and often avoiding the non-corner\nedge squares, at least until later in the game.\nThese counter-intuitive ideas, though they\nmay be difficult for the beginning Othello\nplayer to appreciate, are the key to a winning\nOthello strategy!

{"input":"Read the following article and answer the question.\nArticle: Square Evaluation\nOnce understood, the logic of the correct\nstrategy to winning Othello seems quite\nstraightforward. Your hope is to get your\nopponent to make a poor move that will al-\nlow you to win the game (e.g. get early ac-\ncess to a corner etc.). Obviously, your oppo-\nnent, especially if he is a skilled player, is\nO\nO\nO\nO\nnot likely to make such a move willingly.\nC) Your goal, therefore is to force him to make\na poor move. How can this be accom-\neeeoo00 \u00ae plished? Quite simply, if your opponent has\nonly very few (ideally just one or two) legal\nmoves, and they are poor moves, then your\nopponent will be required (by the rules of\nDiagram 6: Black to move\nOthello: Brief & Basic\n\fthe game) to make a poor move. In the ex-\ntreme case, where your opponent has only\none move, he is said to have a forced move. ,\nAn example is given in Diagram 5. Here,\nBlack wisely chooses to go to e8. The wis-\ndom of Black's move quickly becomes evi-\ndent: White now has only one move, to b2,\nwhich will allow Black to get the al corner\nand inevitably win the game. A slightly\nmore subtle example of the same principle is\nin Diagram 6. Here, if Black moves to g6(!),\nWhite is again forced to the b2 X-square.\nNote that any other move for Black (e.g. f6,\ng5) opens up new moves for White, thus\neliminating the forced move to b2.\nIn more general terms, your goal is move\nlimitation, or limiting the number of moves\n(often referred to as options) that your oppo-\nnent has.

Another example\ned in Diagrams 7, 8, and 9. In all three dia-\ngrams, Black is contemplating a move to f8\n(an A-square). In Diagram 7, such a move\nwould be a disaster. It flips the whole f col-\numn to Black, and after a White move to a2,\nBlack would be forced to go to either b2 or\nb7 (X-squares) on his next move, losing ei-\nther the al or a8 comer. In Diagram 8, the\nmove to f8 is moderately successful, but by\nflipping the discs at f6 and f7, it cuts off ac-\ncess to other squares (particularly g8) which\ncould be important later. A move to g4\nwould probably have been better. Contrast\nthis to the move to f8 in Diagram 9. Here,\nthe move does not open up any new moves\nfor White, while it retains the g8 option for\nBlack. It is an excellent move in terms of\nmobility optimization. In fact, after White-\na2, Black-g8, itis now White who will lose a\ncorner!

Good Moves and Bad Moves: Gaining Control\nWhat constitutes a good move in Othello? Without reference to specific positions, a\ngood move can be typically defined in terms of the principles of gaining and maintain-\ning control (with the ultimate aim of acquiring stable discs). That is, a move that in-\ncreases, maintains or minimally decreases your future mobility while simultaneously\nlimiting your opponent's mobility is a good move. Unfortunately, applying this princi-\nple to specific positions is often far from a simple matter. Here are some guidelines:\nIt is technically possible to have control of the game with more discs on the board\nthan your opponent, with less discs, or with about an equal number of discs. However,\nmost expert players agree that the easiest way to get control of the game is by maintain-\ning fewer discs than your opponent (1.e. maintaining a low disc count). This is referred\nto as evaporation strategy. The rationale for this is that, since your opponent needs to\nQuestion: Which of the following is the easiest way to get control of the game?\nAnswer:","output":"Maintaining fewer discs than your opponent."}
{"input":"to as evaporation strategy. The rationale for this is that, since your opponent needs to\nflip at least one of your discs to make a legal move, the less discs you have on the board,\nthe less legal moves he is likely to have (i.e. move limitation). Thus, in Diagrams 7-9,\nthe f8 move in Diagram 7 could be said to be the worst because it flipped the most discs,\nwhile the move to f8 in Diagram 9 was the best because it flipped the least discs. The\nadvantages of this approach are so great that if one player makes judicious use of evapo-\nration while the other does not, the evaporation strategist will almost always win.\nIt may be, particularly in a game between two experts, that neither player can estab-\nlish a successful evaporation. The game remains roughly even until the endgame. Alter-\nnatively, one player may succeed in getting control of the game early and acquiring one\nor more comers. At these points, evaporation inevitably becomes less important. After\nall, at some point you have to start flipping lots of discs or you cannot win the game.\nThus, the value of each square, in terms of the number of stable discs that will be ac-\nquired, becomes more important. For this reason, evaporation strategy tends to have de-\ncreased importance for endgame play.\nSimilarly, the ultimate goal remains mobility optimization, not simply evaporation.\nA move that flips several discs may at times leave your opponent with less options than\nAccording to the above context, answer the following question.\nWhat is the goal of the game?","output":"to get the most stable discs"}

For example, in this section we demon-\nstrate a \"trick\" or a \"trap\" that will force your opponent to concede a corner, no matter\nhow many moves he might have available at the time. It requires that your opponent oc-\ncupy a C-square along an edge that is otherwise empty (or nearly so)(1.e. an isolated C-\nsquare). Actually, this trap will rarely occur in a game between good players, because\nthey will avoid the positions that would permit it. However, the threat of such traps 1s\noften sufficient to constrain your opponent's\nh moves. In any case, you need to know of\nthese traps, if only to avoid falling into them\nyourself.\nTwo examples of this trap are given in\nDiagrams 12 and 13. In Diagram 12, Black\nfollowed White's move to gl (the isolated\nC-square) with a move to dl. White is now\nunable to take any moves along the critical\nNorth edge and so might choose to go to g5,\n(for example). Wherever White goes, Black\ncontinues with f1!

In this section, we discuss\nthe most basic of these situations: the unbal-\nanced edge.

Thus, unlike the isolated C-square positions\ndiscussed in Point #6, a C-square move would be considered a good move. However, in\nDiagram 15, White could not balance the edge because (since c2 was White) White did\nnot have access to b1.\nBut now a note about defense: In situations like the one in Diagram 15, after Black\ngoes to b2, White's best immediate defense is often to do just about anything except take\nQuestion: When did White's best immediate defense take place?\nAnswer:","output":"After Black goes to b2"}

Actually, experts \"take\" unbalanced edges (i.e. make a move that results in the\nformation of an unbalanced edge) quite often, and not merely when itis the lesser of al-\nternative evils. Taking an unbalanced edge can be a strong, even a game-winning,\nmove.

Typically, Black will try to move to\na square that cuts across (i.e. flips a disc\nalong) the main diagonal, so as to gain ac-\ncess to a8 (e.g. Black moves to f3). But\nWhite's next move is to d8 (called the \"at-\ntack\" square) (see Diagram 20). Now there is\nno way to stop White from getting the h8\ncorer (and most of the south edge as well).\nBlack cannot go to b8 or he will flip the disc\nat b7 and lose both the a8 and h8 corners. If\nBlack takes the corner at a8, White can then\ntake h8 directly or even (in this case) take\nthe wedge at b8 (maintaining access to h8).\nIf Black avoids both a8 and b8, White still\ncan go to h8 at any time (an advantage of\nthis position over a similar unbalanced edge\nattack). This exchange of corners is usually\n(but not always) favorable to the attacker\nsince he gets both the edge and a corner,\nwhile his opponent gets only a corner.\nAccording to the above context, answer the following question.\nWhat is the name of the trap that depends on main diagonal control?","output":"Stoner Trap"}

If you can\nmaintain control of a main diagonal, you\ncan move to the X-squares without allowing\nyour opponent access to the adjacent cor-\nners. In the endgame, this can be a critical\nadvantage (even in non-Stoner trap posi-\ntions). For example, in Diagram 22, White\ncan go to b2 and assume control of the a1-h8\ndiagonal.

At the same time, we saw several cases\n(e.g. unbalanced edges, Stoner traps) where deliberately giving up a comer (typically by\ngoing to an X-square) was a good (even a game-winning) move. Understanding these posi-\ntions typically depended on being able to recognize particular board patterns. But more\nthan that, these positions demonstrated an important principle about Othello. Specifically,\nin a typical game between two expert Othello players, one player is rarely able to acquire\nall 4 comers. Recognizing this, the critical question becomes not how to prevent your op-\nponent from ever getting a commer, but when 1s the best time (and how is the best way) to\nconcede a corner.

{"input":"Read the following article and answer the question.\nArticle: concede a corner. It is almost always better to concede a corner on your terms than to be\nforced to give up a corner later on your opponent's terms. As comedians are fond of saying:\n\"It's all in the timing!\" Indeed, many players, even experts, have lost games essentially be-\ncause they were too reluctant to give away a corner at an opportune time. On the other\nhand, players may also lose games by overlooking unusual ways to force an opponent to\ngive up a corner (or other positional advantage), ways that work only because the timing or\nposition is \"right.\" The next few sections expand on these fundamental concepts.\n9. Gaining and Losing Tempo\nA player is said to gain a tempo when he achieves an advantage of timing by deriv-\ning one more viable move than his opponent from play within a limited area of the\nboard and thereby forcing the opponent to initiate play elsewhere (it is similar to the\nconcept of sente \u2014 or initiative \u2014in Go). Gaining and maintaining a tempo advantage 1s\nakey concept in Othello strategy. Let's look at this idea in more detail.\nA safe move is loosely defined as a move that is not the proximate cause of giving\nyour opponent a comer. For example, going to an X-square early in the game is defi-\nnitely not a safe move. This definition does not take into consideration the numerous\ntres that giving up a corer is a good\nmove, but it serves us well for the majority\nof midgame situations.

It is useful\nto keep track of the number of safe moves\navailable to you (and to your opponent) in\neach of these regions. As play expands to\nthe periphery of the board, we can initially\nconceive of each side of the board as having\n10 potentially safe squares (see Diagram\n25), though this can change with the board\nposition. The move to the last safe square\navailable to either player in a given area of\nthe board is called the last move (making\nthe last move of the game a special case of\nthe \"last move\"). Taking a \"last move\" has\nthe generally desirable effect of forcing Diagram 25: Shaded ogreas\nyour opponent to initiate play elsewhere on are \"safe move\" regions\nthe board. If your opponent has no other\nsafe moves on the board, you are said to have \"run your opponent out of moves\"\n(causing your opponent to concede a corner) (see also Point #3). Gaining a tempo is of-\nten an effective way to accomplish these goals (see also Point #10).\nFor example, in Diagram 26, it is White to play. Note that Black has only one safe\nmove on the board: g5. If White can eliminate this without opening up any more safe\nmoves, White will gain a comer.

The h6 move doesn't succeed:\nBlack simply goes to g5 and White is now\nforced to open up the North edge (see Dia-\ngram 27). The g5 move is correct: this opens\nup a new safe move for Black (h6), but after\nBlack goes there, White can continue with\nh7(!) (Diagram 28). White has now gotten\nthe last move in that region (via a gain in\ntempo) and (in this case) Black is forced to\ngive up a comer. Whenever you find your-\nself with more safe moves than your oppo-\nnent (and a means of reducing your oppo-\nnent's safe moves), it is worth considering\nattempting this. As usual, success depends\nupon being able to plan ahead: coming up\none move short of running your opponent\nout of moves often spells disaster. Another\nword of caution: recall that X-squares are\nnot always bad moves, and forcing your op-\nponent to concede a corner may not hurt\nhim. Thus, in Diagram 28, imagine that a7\nwas vacant. Now after a White move to h7,\nBlack (though forced to give up a corner)\ngoes to the b7 X-square, attacking the un-\nbalanced west edge.

Free moves are like money in the\nbank. Don't use them until you need to or un-\ntil you can make good use of them. Thus, in\nDiagram 29, it would be a mistake for White\nto take this free move now. Black would\nsimply respond with c8 and White 1s forced\nto open up the North side of the board for\nBlack (or concede a corner). Instead, White\nshould play to c8 directly, leading to a likely\nb8 response by Black. Now White goes to\nh7 and Black is out of safe moves entirely.\nAnother dramatic example of the power\nof free moves is in Diagram 30. Here Black\nhas two free moves at a2 and a7.

A related concept is \"unpoi-\nsoning\": changing a currently undesirable\nmove for an opponent into a desirable one by\nflipping a disc that was acting to poison the\nopponent's move.

For example, in Dia-\ngram 43, about the only way that White can\npermanently prevent Black's good move to\nf3 is to take it himself. However, White may\nbe reluctant to do this because it also flips\nthe Black discs at f4 and f5, creating a White\nwall along the east side. None-the less, the\nmove works out well for White: no matter\nwhere Black goes next, White can eventual-\nly get the excellent move to e6, and the pres-\nsure is now on Black.\nIn summary, when your opponent has a\ngood move, there are generally three things\nyou can do to prevent it: a) deny access to\nthe move, b) poison the move, or c) take the\nmove yourself. Of course, if you have more\nthan enough good moves yourself, you may\nsimply choose to ignore your opponent's\ngood move altogether. If more than one of\nthese alternatives is possible, the best one\ncan only be determined (surprise!) by exam-\nining the overall board position (see also\nPoint #15).\n12. The Semi-Forcing Move\nA semi-forced move is a move which is\nforced not by the rules of the game, but rath-\ner by tactical considerations. In practice, the\n\"tactical consideration\" is most often that,\nunless the player takes the semi-forced\nmove, he will lose a corner. The opponent's\nmove that puts a player in this position is\ncalled the semi-forcing move. Proper use of\nsemi-forcing moves can be a powerful tech-\nnique, and really we have already seen sev-\neral examples of it.

Thus, the e8 move in Di-\nagram 38 (though it did not directly threaten\na comer) semi-forced a d8 response, sealing\nWhite off from the southwest corner area.\nLet's look at a few more examples.\nIn Diagram 44, White would have a great\nmove to f7, if it was not poisoned by his\ndiscs at f1 and f2. White can set this up by\nfirst moving to el, semi-forcing a g1 reply\nOthello: Brief & Basic\n\fby Black (and flipping the critical f1 and f2 discs). Now White continues with f7 and\nBlack must sacrifice a corner, and the game!\nIn Diagram 45, Black would like to block White's access to b1. He can do this by\nmoving to a3. This semi-forces an a4 reply, which in turn flips the c2 disc to White, pre-\nventing White from balancing the edge. Having accomplished this, Black has another\nsemi-forcing move available that is probably even better: go to h5 (adjacent to White's\nuneven three). This semi-forces White to respond with h6, flipping the Black discs in\nthe sixth row to White (sharply reducing White's future mobility).\n13. Mobility Reconsidered\nWith the perspective of our most recent discussions, let's now re-examine some 1s-\nsues related to the all-important principle of mobility optimization (see Points #3 & 4).\nRegional Mobility. In some situations, there may be several safe moves that all flip\nabout the same amount of discs. A strict application of evaporation techniques suggest\nthey should be about equally good moves.

{"input":"Read the following context and answer the question.\nContext: they should be about equally good moves. How do you decide between them?\nOne idea, previously discussed, is to prefer the move that flips more interior discs.\nBut what if (as is more common) all your choices are about equal in this respect as well?\nHere you should still be guided by the idea that you want to open up as few new safe\nmoves for your opponent as possible. One general rule is (almost paradoxically) take\nthe move that is in the area where your opponent already has the most amount of poten-\ntial moves (i.e. the area of greatest regional mobility). The logic is that discs flipped in\nthis region will only minimally increase your opponent's mobility since they will tend to\nprovide access to squares that the opponent already has access to. Another way of stat-\ning this same rule is: move to the area where your own mobility is the most limited. The\nhope is to lure play into this area, getting your opponent to use up all his safe moves\nthere, thereby eliminating his regional advantage.\nOne example is in Diagram 46, where it is White to move. Let's consider the vari-\nous possibilities. Clearly, a move like f3 would be undesirable, flipping seven discs\n(mostly along the frontier), and severely lim-\niting White's future mobility. A move to g3\nmay seem initially to be a good move as it a_eb\nonly flips one black disc.

For\nexample, a move to a6 does not open up any\nnew moves for Black! Note that not all\nmoves in this western region are necessarily\nequal. For example, compare the a6 move to\nanother similar, though less desirable, move\nto b6. The b6 move, by flipping both the\ndiscs at b5 and c5, totally shuts off the region\nto White, while the a6 move only \"picks off\"\n(i.e. flips) the b5 disc, leaving the c5 disc for a possible White move to b6 on his next\nturn.\nSometimes, if you can see ahead a sufficient number of moves, you may realize\nthat after all the exchanges of moves in an open region, your opponent will get the last\nmove and you will be forced to open up a closed (to your opponent) region anyway (e.g.\neast region is closed to Black in Diagram 46).

Sometimes, particu-\nlarly in some opening positions, the best way\nto mimimize your opponent's options is with\nthe opposite of evaporation: obtaining a vast\nmajority of discs rather than a minimum.\nThis is especially true if you can leave your\nopponent's discs scattered along the frontier\nwhere they tend to block each other's moves\n(called checkerboarding your opponent).\nThe goal here is to force your opponent to\nmake a bad move before he can regain con-\ntrol of the center and attack your suddenly\nvulnerable position.

Most of what we have discussed thus far bears primarily on the mid-\ngame. The extreme beginning and end of the game are special cases and deserve special\nconsideration. We will focus on them (as well as one additional aspect of midgame strate-\ngy) in the next several points. Some of this discussion will be a repetition of material cov-\nered in previous points, except now the focus will be on a particular phase of the game.\n14. The Opening: The Three Basic Variations\nThere is a feeling, among many Othello players, that generalizations of strategy\nhave such limited applicability in the opening, as to be practically useless. In particular,\nwith so few discs on the board, positions are too volatile and relative advantages too\neasily shifted to currently visualize a move's ultimate worth. Thus, there are no immedi-\nate goals in the opening (according to this viewpoint); one simply avoids major blun-\nders and hopes that an advantageous midgame position (in terms of mobility etc.) will\nresult. In my opinion, this is only partially true. Some ideas about strategy and tactics in\nthe opening can be forcefully made (see Point #15). At the same time, as in games like\nQuestion: What is the author's opinion of the opening?\n===\nThe answer to the above question is","output":"He believes there are some ideas that can be made."}
{"input":"Read the following article and answer the question.\nArticle: the opening can be forcefully made (see Point #15). At the same time, as in games like\nchess, it will also be useful to develop an \"opening book\" (1.e. a collection of prepared,\nmemorized sequences of opening moves that are followed primarily because previous\nexperience has shown them to work well). All expert players have at least a limited\nopening book. There is also some general agreement about which are the better open-\nings (with the result that some openings occur quite frequently, while others do not oc-\ncur at all).\nSome players limit their opening books to the first 6-8 moves, relying on their gener-\nal knowledge about Othello to carry them from that pomt. Other players have an exten-\nsive collection of potential openings (tediously prepared!), often reaching to move 20\nand beyond. The success of these longer prepared openings depends upon many things,\nnot the least of which is the ability to anticipate an opponent's likely responses (e.g.\nthere is no point in preparing an opening sequence to counteract a move that no oppo-\nnent will ever make!). Despite the difficulties in preparing these longer openings, I be-\nlieve they are worth the effort. First, it allows you to make moves \"automatically,\" sav-\ning time on your clock (which is important in tournaments, where you typically have 30\nminutes or less to make all your moves).

Until such skills are acquired, the best course for such a player 1s\nto study (and memorize) the openings already used by expert players. There 1s not suffi-\ncient space in this Handbook to detail even close to a majority of these expert openings.\nHowever, we can discuss some of the most common sequences in the first 8-10 moves.\nTranscripts of games from tournaments (as regularly published in OQ) are particularly\ngood sources of further ideas about openings. As you gain experience, you will hopeful-\nly develop the ability to expand upon and add to these openings.\nThe first point about openings is that Black's first move 1s not really a choice at all.\nThat is, all 4 of Black's potential first moves are either a rotation or a mirror image of\neach other. It is White that makes the first move that affects the course of the game. So,\nfor simplicity, let's assume Black's first move is always to c4.

The position after the most common\nsequence for the first four moves (1. c4, 2.\nc3, 3. d3, 4. c5) is shown in Diagram 50.\nThis is a critical point in this opening, in that\nBlack now has 9 squares from which to\nchoose (In fact, it is this mobility for Black\nthat has led many players to abandon this\nopening as White).

PQMs are so powerful that moves that\nwould normally not be desirable become\ngood if they can set-up or block a PQM.

Midgame Strategy: Patterns\nWe have already discussed a great deal about midgame strategy. Evaporation, unbal-\nanced edges, tempo gains etc. all have their greatest relevance in the midgame. Howev-\ner, in an actual game, it may not always be easy to apply these principles. Once again,\nwe return to the issue of how to determine a \"good move.\" In many cases, a global view\nof the midgame can assist in your decision making. This can be best achieved by view-\ning the board position as one of several possible patterns. Not all midgames will fit one\nof these patterns, but many of them will. Some patterns are \"even\" \u2014 others are one-\nsided. In either case, recognizing the pattern can be a guide as to what move to make\nnext. But be especially careful: these patterns are transient! One or two moves can\ntransform the board from one type of pattern to another. In fact, the major goal of cer-\ntain moves may be to effect a change to a more favorable pattern.\nThe Sandwich. This describes a pattern\nwhere one player's pieces are surrounded on\ntwo sides by opponent's pieces (see Dia- 1\ngram 57). This is a one-sided position: the\nplayer with the inside position (Black in Di-\nagram 57) is generally considered to be\nahead.

Typically, White's best strategy here\nis to make waiting type moves, squeezing\nout every last option for a move, hoping to\nforce Black out of the sandwich before the\nsituation becomes hopeless. In this case,\nWhite may go to b3, which leaves Black  Uiagram 37: Black to move\nwithout an obvious next move.

Aside from such moves\nbeing good from a general perspective (e.g. avoiding walls, flipping few frontier discs\netc.), bisecting your opponent's pieces tends to shift the X position towards a favorable\nsandwich position. The opponent must do his best to counteract this on his next turn.\nThus (in Diagram 58) White is liklely to go to g6, while Black is likely to continue with\nc7. If neither player gets a clear advantage, the outcome will be decided in the endgame,\nafter the edges start to fill up (and the X-pattern typically begins to look more like a\ncross pattern).\n[A slight digression: White might possibly choose to go to c7 rather than g6, taking\naway Black's expected c7 response. This would pressure Black to consider a move to\nd1, blocking (at least temporarily) White's ability to take g6 on his next move. This rap-\nidly develops into a very different type of game than if White had started with g6.]\nThe Double Wall. Despite the admonition against forming walls, a wall can be de-\nsirable if it pressures your opponent to form one as well. This leads to a double wall (Di-\nagram 59). This is generally an even position, at least as long as the double wall is main-\ntained. The goal, of course, is to get your opponent to break across and erode your wall\nbefore you must do so to his wall. This typically requires making waiting type moves\nQuestion: What is probably true about the author?\nAnswer:","output":"They are an expert at chess"}
{"input":"Read the following article and answer the question.\nArticle: before you must do so to his wall. This typically requires making waiting type moves\n(using up as few options as possible with each move), creating an ever more extensive\nwall as you do so. Thus, White may go to e7,\nh with Black continuing to e8 (not f8, which\nallows a d8 response by White), each player\nmoving so as to extend his own wall.\nThe risk here is that, if you fail in your\ngoal, you may quickly find yourself in a\nhopeless position. So sometimes, if you can\nperceive that you will lose the double wall\nbattle, it pays to cut across your opponent's\nwall immediately. Typically, you would try\nto cut through the wall in a way that mini-\nmizes your opponent's gain in options, while\nattempting to shift towards a favorable sand-\nwich position.

The result is\nfrequently a sort of double wall, except one\nplayer (the initiator of the pattern) typically\nhas his wall along two edges, while the op-\nponent's pieces are all in the interior of the\nboard (see Diagram 61). In such a position, ry\nthe player with the edge pieces is said to try\nto \"creep along the edge\" (i.c. take a series ry  )\nof contiguous edge moves while keeping his\nopponent off the edges; also see Diagram Diagram 61: Blac\n11). If successful, the initiating player soon\nruns the opponent out of safe moves (.e. op-\ntions are being limited by the fact that you\ncan't flip past an edge), and the opponent will\nAccording to the above context, answer the following question.\nWhat is probably true about the author?","output":"he is very knowledgeable about Othello"}

Thus, in Dia- 1\ngram 61, Black goes to h7, leaving White\nwith only one safe move at c7. Black then\ncontinues with c8, and White is forced to\nconcede a comer (and probably the game).\nHowever, this \"creeping\" strategy carries\nextreme risks: if the opponent can hold on,\nwithout running out of options, until the mid-\ngame (or even later), the initiating player's\nlong edge walls and lack of central discs will\ncollapse on him as his opponent's more con-\nventional advantages finally turn the tide.\nThus, in Diagram 62, Black failed in his\nedge double wall attempt. He must now start\nmaking moves across White's wall, giving Diagram 62: Black to move\nWhite new safe moves, and greatly deterio-\nrating Black's position. As alluded to in\nPoints #14 and #15, the Heath opening (because of its early exit from the sweet six-\nteen) is noted for Black initiating an edge double wall.\nO\nee\noe\nOO\n\u00a9\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\n\u00a9\neo | we\nLee ee\noOo -\u2014 mm Oo & HW\nto move\n=\nOo som th f& WwW hi\nCheckerboards. Though checkerboarding patterns (see Point #13) are most fre-\nquently seen in the opening, they may occasionally persist to the midgame.

Thus, the midgame checkerboard is usually reserved for desperate positions,\nwhere all other options seem even worse.\nIn summary, while all these patterns hold true to many of the basic concepts of\nOthello strategy discussed previously, the exact subgoals can vary dramatically from\npattern to pattern. In addition, within a pattern, the correct subgoal may vary depending\nupon whether you are on the offensive (e.g. initiator) or defensive side of the pattern.\nKnowing how to handle each type of pattern is critical to successful midgame play.\nOthello: Brief & Basic 29\n\fSummary & Preview\nThe previous sections covered material ranging from the most basic principles of con-\ntrol, mobility, and corner sacrifices \u2014 to discussions of tempo and access -- to finally an ex-\namination of strategy specific to the opening and midgame.

The Endgame: The Final Count\nPrevious sections have emphasized the principle of evaporation: how the best move\nof the game is often the one that flips the least amount of discs (see Points #1-#5 for re-\nview). But clearly, this has to come to an end at some point - after all the objective of\nOthello is to finish the game with the most\nfa h amount of discs. So now, we have arrived at\nour discussion of the endgame. Clearly, with\nOW only a few moves left, now is the time to go\nfor broke and flip as many discs as you can,\n S right? Well, it's almost right. The idea is not\nnecessarily to flip the most amount of discs\non each turn, but to flip the most amount of\ndiscs relative to your opponent. The differ-\nence can be seen in Diagram 63. Here it is\nBlack to play at move 59. The move to the\nh1 corner flips 8 discs while the alternative\nmove to h2 only flips 2 discs.

Clearly what is needed is an ability to\ncount the position: determine the net gain or loss of discs for all the remaining possible\nsequence of moves.\nThere are many possible ways to count discs, and even the experts disagree as to the\nbest way. Here, I will present one method of counting that could have guided you to the\nbest move in Diagram 63. Consider first the hl move: Black flips eight discs (+8) and in\naddition places down 1 new disc (+1) for a gain of +9 (1.e. 8 +1). White continues by\nflipping 10 black discs back to white for a loss (for Black) of \u201410. The result is (+9) + GC\n10) = -1, or a net loss of 1 disc for Black. Compare this to the result if Black takes h2\nfirst: Now Black flips 2 discs plus adds a new disc to the board (+3), while White flips\nonly 1 black disc when he goes to h1 (-1) for a net result of (+3) + 1) = +2. Since +2 is\na better final result than \u20141, then h2 is a better move for Black than h1.\nClearly, with more moves remaining (and with more choices at each move and discs\npossibly getting flipped back and forth several times before the game is over), determin-\ning the best move by counting can be extremely difficult, if not impossible.

So, we humans have to rely on strategic generalizations to help us\nthrough most of the endgame (see also Point #18).

But h2 is not Black's best re-\nsponse and White should not count on Black going there. If Black goes to g1 instead,\nWhite finishes with h2 and loses 31-33 (+3-\u2014\n5+7 = +5).

This raises one of the more complex issues in all of Othello. These next\ntwo sections present some useful general guidelines for dealing with this issue.\nAs discussed earlier (see Points #1 - #5), players unaware of move limitation strate-\ngy often feel its best to take edge squares as soon and as often as possible. While it's true\nthat ultimate possession of at least some edge squares is usually necessary to win, this\n\"rush to the edge\" concept has been clearly discredited. In fact, some expert players\nOthello: Brief & Basic 35\n\fOo \u2014- om th f& WwW hi\nOo a om UO fF Wo ht\n36\nbelieve it is best to avoid taking edge squares for as long as it is feasible. By this view,\nedge square moves tend to become liabilities later in the game (by poisoning otherwise\ngood moves etc.). Personally, I would advise against either extreme. Indeed, edge\nsquare moves do have at least one distinct advantage: there are less ways to flip an edge\npiece than a interior piece. Thus, the proper and judicious use of edge moves may help\npromote move limitation. Also, once your opponent has gone to an edge, a move to that\nedge often becomes much more desirable for you. Finally, recall that we have previous-\nly discussed a special tempo-gaining edge technique: \"creeping along the edge\" (see\nPoints #5 & #16).\nFor simplicity, our discussions will usually focus only on one edge at a time, in rela-\nQuestion: What is probably true about the author?\nAnswer:","output":"He likes to play Othello"}
{"input":"Read the following context and answer the question.\nContext: For simplicity, our discussions will usually focus only on one edge at a time, in rela-\ntive isolation from the rest of the board. But be aware that, in a real game, edge moves\nmust be evaluated using general principles and in the context of the entire board - the in-\nterior area as well as the other three edges. For example, in Diagram 77, Black decides\nto take the edge move to a4. The major rationale for this decision was not any special at-\ntribute of the west edge, but the fact that, by flipping c4, it set up a Perfectly Quiet\nMove (see Point #15) to e6. An edge move to a3 or a5, or almost any other non-edge\nmove would not have accomplished this. In other cases, edge move choices may be pri-\nmarily dictated by the number of non-edge discs flipped (e.g. Diagram 77 as well as Di-\nagrams 7,8 & 9 in Point #3).\nThere are two major goals, beyond the\na booed oe f 9g oh general ones of move limitation strategy, to\nbear in mind when deciding to go to an edge\n(prior to comers being occupied): 1.

Try to obtain a desirable final edge posi-\ntion or force your opponent to take an unde-\nsirable one (e.g. an unbalanced edge).

This is because, since Black does not have access to b6, White's move to b5 does\nnot open up any obviously good moves for Black. The pressure is now on Black. It's be-\ncause even experts disagree about the best move in positions like this that each Othello\ngame tums out differently.\nAnother example (Diagram 79) presents a less ambiguous set of choices. It is White\nto play. Note the relative advantages of a move to a6 vs. h6. The a6 move allows an\neasy a4 response for Black. White has gained nothing: neither a tempo nor a positional\nadvantage. In contrast, the h6 move looks much better: Black cannot respond with h\u00e94. If\nBlack responds with h5, White continues with h4 (gaining a tempo at very little cost po-\nsitionally).

In either case, Black could flip the\nWhite disc on his next turn (e.g. White - a3;\nBlack - a2), leaving White with no more\nmoves along the edge.

However, this table is also disadvantageous in that it is a\nclosed edge to White: White has no access to any of the remaining vacant squares along\nthe edge (unless Black moves there first). In contrast, the table along the South edge 1s\nnot closed to White: since c7 and d7 are Black, White maintains considerable safe ac-\ncess to the edge (i.e. it remains an open edge for White). The vacant square at f7 should\nalso be considered among the possible moves in this region: White can probably gain a\ntempo by going there, but will lose all access to the h8 corner region by doing so. Final-\nly, note that White's North edge position has created a type of weakness referred to as a\nhole (d1). White has no access to this square but Black can wedge in there with a free\nmove at any time he wishes. Though experts sometimes find it useful to create these\nholes (typically to gain a necessary tempo), they should be avoided as a general rule.\nThe next three diagrams show some selected positions after Black has gone to an\nedge initialized by White. In these diagrams, the edge decisions are simplified by the\nfact that the 4 squares immediately interior to the A and B edge squares are all occu-\npied. Obviously, im actual games, this will not always be the case. In Diagram 81, there\nare two edges where Black followed White's A-square moves by going to the adjacent\nB-square.

This move\nis called the decisive move (though occa-\nsionally the critical nature of such a move\nwill not be apparent until looked at in retro-\nspect one or two moves later). I realize this\nis a subjective definition, since recognition\nof a decisive move will depend upon a\nplayer's overall Othello ability. But I still be-\nlieve itis an instructive concept.\nAn example of this concept is in Dia-\ngram 87. White has an opportunity to make\na decisive move. Before reading further, see\nif you can find it. Ready? Okay. White\nshould go to al! Though this is a fairly obvi-\nous choice to Othello experts, less skilled\nplayers (who have learned about the danger\nof unbalanced edges) may be surprised. Af-\nter all, this move allows Black to follow by\ntaking the wedge at bl, gaining undeniable\naccess to h1 securing both the north and east\nedges. Despite all this, after al-b1l-a7-h1-g2,\nWhite gets the remaining 2 corners and\nmore than enough discs to win the game. In\ncontrast, if White takes the seemingly desir-\nable quiet move to a7 (rather than a1 initial-\nly), it quickly leads to disaster. Black fol-\nlows with g7, gaining control of the al-h8\nmain diagonal. Now White can no longer go\nto al. He has missed his chance at a decisive\nmove, and is now set up to lose all four cor-\nners and the game. In essence, Black's g7\n(rather than White's potential al) became\nthe decisive move of the game.

I was Black and none of my possible\nchoices at move 41 seemed to lead to the clear-cut path to victory that I was seeking. Fi-\nnally, I discovered a truly wonderful (and decisive) move: a5!

The game was now \"over\":\nWhite would be forced to concede the h1 corner and I had b1, b7, and b8 as free moves\nwhenever I wanted them!\nThough \"provable\" decisive moves are a ob\nlimited to the endgame, moves that appear to\nbe decisive (1.e. that seem to be a pivotal\nturning point in the game) can occur much\nearlier, even in the opening phase. For exam-\nple, Diagram 89 is taken from a game I\nplayed in the 1982 U.S. Nationals. I went to\ncl at move 18 which set up an edge trap of\nthe sort described in Diagram 82 (i.e. Black\nhas no access to e1). In this case, Black has\neven worse problems: if he chooses to go to\nb1 (to avoid the loss of tempo), White could\ncontinue with g2, setting up a Stoner trap\n(see Point #8).

This, in turn, de-\ntermines which move to take. For example, it may be that if you do not immediately\nblock your opponent's good move, your opponent will gain a clear advantage (or, in the\nworst case, a decisive winning position). Clearly, you must prevent this if you can.\nThus, White's decision in Diagram 87 to make the al move, as opposed to a7 (or any\nother move), can be viewed as based on the recognition that preventing Black from\ngaining control of the al-h8 main diagonal was the most critical, highest priority con-\ncern at that moment. All other considerations were secondary. It wouldn't matter wheth-\ner White knew that al was a winning move or not. It would be sufficient for White to\nknow that unless he stopped Black from getting control of the main diagonal, it would\nlead to a sure loss.\nDiagram 90 presents another example on this topic.

Who seems to have the lead and who is playing defensively in each phase of the\ngame? When did the decisive move occur?) Note that the timing or sequencing of moves is\noften critical: a move that wins the game if taken immediately, may be a game-losing blun-\nder by the player's next turn.

Former World Champion Brian Rose has been writing his \nbook for over 3 years and every time I asked the other tournament regulars about it, there was no new \nnews on it.  I finally decided that I was tired of waiting and started to work on my own book. \n \nWhile most of my counterparts are usually only playing against other top players, I play many games \nagainst people who are still learning, and I think I have special insight into the kinds of questions that \nthey might have.  I\u2019ve put a lot of effort into the diagrams and exercises, in fact, many of the exercises \nin this book are based on positions that I consistently see beginning level players misplay. \n \nI\u2019m sure that there are mistakes in this version.  In fact, every time I go through it I find one more thing \nI need to fix, however, I think that the form that it is in now is suitable for general consumption.  I\u2019m still \nworking on the rest of the book.  It\u2019s taken me three full months to get through the beginner material.  I\nAccording to the above context, answer the following question.\nWhat does the author do for a living?","output":"He is a professional Othello player."}

If there is no interest in it from the established publishing community, I will be looking into \nselling it (the thought of printing out copies at Kinko\u2019s and shipping them myself has crossed my \nmind).  Part of the reason I\u2019m giving this away is that it\u2019s good for the Othello community.  I\u2019m also \nhoping that people will like it and it will generate interest in my book.

{"input":"principles to some of the more flexible principles and exceptions that Master level players apply in \nchampionship level play. \n \nIn essence, what I\u2019m trying to do is write the Othello equivalent of Nimzovich\u2019s My System (a chess \nbook).  At the current time, there is no book in the Othello world to form the basis for discussion and \nanalysis of games.  Most master level discussions in the US occur over a real board at infrequent \ntournaments and I\u2019ve tried to present as much of the terminology as possible.

After all, black has 59 disks while white only has 1.  Unfortunately, not very many of black\u2019s \ndisks will remain black at the end of the game, in fact, in this position, white will get to play to all four \ncorners (because black will have no legal moves) and will win the game.

The simple answer is that \na corner is a guaranteed stable disk because there are no moves that outflank a corner.  A stable \ndisk is a disk that your opponent can never flip back to his or her color.  Obviously, the more disks \nyou have that are guaranteed to be your color at the end of the game, the more likely you are to win \nthe game. Another great thing about corners is that you can use them to build more stable disks.  \nLet\u2019s take a look at another fantasy board to demonstrate how stable disks can be built from corners. \n \n \nWHITE TO PLAY \n \nHere, white can create stable disks along either the A column or the 1 row by building off of the A1 \ncorner.

How does black win a corner?\u201d  The answer is: black can\u2019t win \na corner in this position (at least \u2013 not in the next couple of moves).  What\u2019s different about this \nposition?  Because of black\u2019s disk placement, white only has one \u201cdangerous\u201d move that he could \nplay if it were his turn, A2.  It is very easy for white to avoid playing to A2.  Let\u2019s play fantasy Othello \nfor a bit and move one disk on the board slightly: \n \n \nBLACK TO PLAY \n \nNow black does have a move that wins a corner (black plays B1 and white must play B2).

As mentioned in the last chapter, edge disks can only be \nflipped along the edge so this means that edge moves tend to be quieter than non-edge moves.  \nQuieter moves give your opponent fewer options the next turn.  Eventually if you can play enough \nquiet edge moves, your opponent will run out of other moves and have to give you a corner.  This \nsimple strategy is known as edge creeping because you are attempting to creep slowly along the \nedge until you win a corner. \n \nAnother thing that you should notice is that in the original diagram, the black disk is on the outside of \nthe mass of white disks where it could be flipped \u2013 which means that white has a couple of possible \nmoves to begin with.  Disks that are on the outside of a mass of opposite colored disks that can be \nflipped are called frontier disks.

It also stands to reason that preventing your opponent from getting moves into the Sweet \n16 is also a good thing.  Disks played in the sweet 16 don\u2019t let your opponent reach an edge (where \nthey may try to edge creep).  Additionally, disks in the Sweet 16 are less likely to remain frontier disks \nduring the course of a game. \n \n \nAnother useful rule is that staying in the middle of \nyour opponent\u2019s disks is good.   \n \nThis is called staying central.\nQuestion: What is the purpose of the passage?\nAnswer:","output":"To give advice on how to play Othello."}

In the midgame, your job is usually to avoid running out of mobility while \nretaining a good position and trying to run your opponent out of mobility in return.  Often, you will find \nthat there are moves that you are forced to play or your opponent will run you out of mobility.  Most of \nthe time when I refer to a move as being a forced move, it means that the move must be played to \nprevent the other player from attaining a killer sequence. Obviously, if there is only one valid move on \nthe board it is also a forced move.

Let\u2019s look at a quick example: \n \n \n \nSTARTING POSITION \nBLACK PLAYS G3 \n \nThere are several ways to consolidate disks near the H8 corner \u2013 because the disk at G6 is closer to \nH8 than any of the other white disks, we\u2019ll play G3 \u2013 which flips that disk in the least disruptive way \npossible.

At some point in a closer game you \nhave to remember that you want to have the most disks at the end and more importantly the end is \ngetting near.  You are trying to keep the number of disks that you have to a small number as \nsuggested in the previous sections, right?   \n \nObviously, at the end of the game, keeping your disks to a minimum is not as good of an idea.  You \nhave to start playing moves that take a lot of disks.  Usually, in a fairly even game, this is when there \nare about 8 or 10 empty squares on the board.  Unfortunately there\u2019s no hard or fast rule for when you \nshould start taking a lot of disks, however, if you can take a lot of disks and most are stable or they \nmake other disks that you have stable, then it is probably a good idea. \n \n \nBLACK TO PLAY \n \nWe\u2019ll start with the simple example shown above.  We\u2019re at the last 2 moves of the game \u2013 so this \nshould be easy. This process of calculating the best play sequence is called counting.  Counting is a \ndifficult skill to master and there are many strategies for it.  I prefer to simply employ a plus minus \ncount of disks and see which sequence is \u201coptimal\u201d.\nQuestion: Which of the following is TRUE about the game of Othello?\nAnswer:","output":"There are many strategies for counting."}
{"input":"count of disks and see which sequence is \u201coptimal\u201d. \n \nLet\u2019s count black\u2019s move to A1 first.  Black plays A1, that\u2019s +5 black disks.  White Plays A2 (flipping \nB2), that\u2019s -1 black disk.  So +5 \u2013 1 =  +4 black disks.  The sequence where black plays A1 ends up \nwith 4 more disks than in the original position.  That\u2019s not bad. \n \nJust to be on the safe side, let\u2019s check and make sure that the move to A2 doesn\u2019t get more disks.  \nBlack plays A2 and gets +9 black disks.  White plays A1 and flips B2 and A2, that\u2019s -2 black disks.  +9 \n\u2013 2 = +7 black disks! \nSo, taking the corner in this case is the wrong move.  In fact, if we count the disks currently on the \nboard, black has 26 disks.  26 + 4 = 30.  Black loses 30-34 if he takes the corner.  26 + 7 = 33.  Black \nwins 33-31 if he plays A2.  The difference between winning and losing is in understanding why this is \nthe case.  For one thing,  the move to A2 simply flips more disks.  With only 1 move left, white can\u2019t \nOthello: From Beginner to Master \u2013 Simple Endgame Advice \nCopyright \u00a9 2003, Randy Fang \n \n60 \nflip enough of them back to make the corner worth very much.  Remember, the reason that corners \nare important is that they tend to lead to stable disks.  Here, there isn\u2019t anywhere for white to build off \nof, so the corner isn\u2019t worth very much.  What we can learn from this fiasco is that rules are meant to \nbe broken and that corners become worth less late in the game because there are fewer opportunities\nAccording to the above context, answer the following question.\nWhat is probably true about the author?","output":"They like to play games"}
