"I have a new situation: I have a new situation: A new game is all the rage these days. It's called Othello and it's based on an old Dutch board game called ""Molenkaat"". Othello is a strategic game where two players take turns placing pieces on a board. The goal is to have more pieces of your color on the board than your opponent.

Othello: From Beginner to Master – A Few Words 
Copyright © 2003, Randy Fang 
 
A FEW WORDS 
After the 2003 US National Championships, I set out on a mission to do what few others have even 
attempted – to write a book about Othello.  Former World Champion Brian Rose has been writing his 
book for over 3 years and every time I asked the other tournament regulars about it, there was no new 
news on it.

What is an answer for this question: What is the name of the person who wrote a book about Othello?",Brian Rose
"I finally decided that I was tired of waiting and started to work on my own book.

Given the question ""How would Others feel as a result?"", what is the answer?",relieved
"While most of my counterparts are usually only playing against other top players, I play many games 
against people who are still learning, and I think I have special insight into the kinds of questions that 
they might have.

Q: What does the narrator think they have special insight into?

Referring to the passage above, the correct answer to the given question is",the kinds of questions that they might have
"I have a new situation: Two chess players, both named Bill, are having a match. They both love chess equally, and play it very often. However, one of them, Bill Black, has been playing for much longer than the other, Bill White. Because of this, Bill Black is obviously much better at chess than Bill White.

But I can use this background: I’ve put a lot of effort into the diagrams and exercises, in fact, many of the exercises 
in this book are based on positions that I consistently see beginning level players misplay.

What is an answer for this question: Which player is less likely to misplay a chess position?",Bill Black
"I’m sure that there are mistakes in this version.

Q: What is the narrator sure of?

Referring to the passage above, the correct answer to the given question is",there are mistakes in this version

I need to fix, however, I think that the form that it is in now is suitable for general consumption.

Q: What does the speaker think of the form?

A:",suitable for general consumption
"I’m still

I 
imagine it will take me three months to four months get through the intermediate section, and another 
three months to four months get through the advanced section.",advanced
"Once I finish all of this and re-edit it (add a table of contents, for instance), I intend to look for a 
publisher.

With reference to the above context, What is the narrator going to do after they finish their work?",look for a publisher
"If there is no interest in it from the established publishing community, I will be looking into 
selling it (the thought of printing out copies at Kinko’s and shipping them myself has crossed my 
mind).

Q: What is the narrator thinking of doing if they don't get a publisher?

A:",selling it
"I have a new situation: Two neighbors attended the Othello community college. Brad got a good job offer and had to move away, but his friend Frank stayed. One day, Brad decided to give away some of his old stuff to Frank, among which there was a very valuable violin.

But I can use this background: Part of the reason I’m giving this away is that it’s good for the Othello community.

What is an answer for this question: Which friend gave away a violin?",Brad
"I’m also 
hoping that people will like it and it will generate interest in my book.

Q: What is the narrator hoping that people will like?

Referring to the passage above, the correct answer to the given question is",their book
"I know that the answer to the question ""What is the author doing?"" is in ""If you have any comments, or

His first move is to take an edge disk and flip it along the edge. He notes this move as move A. His second move is to take a corner disk and flip it along the edge. He notes this move as move B.

central to black’s disks.

last section, having fewer frontier disks is usually
